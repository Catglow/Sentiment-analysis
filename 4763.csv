So if you are going to be there make sure you come by and at least say hello. Plus depending on when my flight back is going to be and how soon I can leave the Fair we plan on going somewhere and getting a couple of drinks. So come by drop off a resume and maybe we can get some drinks.

I've done some searching on the net and on CPAN for modules to talk to the database (DBD drivers/etc), and I've found one module called DBD::FreeTDS which can directly talk to MS SQL (however that appears to not even exist anymore).

Please review. As I noted earlier, Barry indicated he had some language that he wanted to revise concerning the mark to market. I have not been able to contact him yet. So unless Mark and Barry have talked, probably need to hold these until you or I hear from Barry. Also, if we are going to do any of these transaction with a Canadian party, Peter Keohane and Eric Ledain need to comment on this form. I have sent them an earlier version and I am copying them here. I will be in a meeting until about 3:30 pm central and will be available after that. I again want to reiterate, that if the assignment takes place after the firm transport agreements are signed, Kern could require the assignment to be done via the capacity release bidding procedures of their tariff. I noticed that one of the packages is less than 1 year in term. This means it could also be bid up in excess of max rate. Anything over 1 year could only be bid to max rate. We may want to add a provision that to the extent the capacity is assigned via capacity release and it is bid up beyond max rate, ENA will have no obilgation to take the capacity and make the mark to market payment. Probably need to discuss this with Mark.",Neutral,2001

To say that it would not be a problem for very large tranches of customers to leave the system as part of ""community aggregation,"" and then say it WOULD be a problem for individual customers to do the same, is, well, ridiculous. In short, if you can work out the terms and conditions under which potentially huge tranches can go DA, then it is certainly feasible to do the same thing for individual customers. Finally, we're checking, but it seems that it will be be extremely difficult to say that its legally kosher for the PUC to permit DA under 9X, but suspend all other DA. Very interesting.

He suggested others could look to Enron as a ""model competitor. They've done a very good job of setting up a strong financial desk and a strong physical desk and we don't see any problem with it. I think they have set up their books in a way that they truly have separation between the regulated and unregulated aspects of their business."" Ross had prefaced the remark, midway through a heated debate on affiliate abuses, with the comment that ""this is not an industry-wide problem. I believe there are good and bad players in the market today."" Earlier, Enron's Leslie Lawner had invited ""all of you to spend the day on Enron's trading floor, because I assure you, you will not see a more competitive environment anywhere. There is no way these folks, who fight like cats and dogs among themselves, would voluntarily transfer value to the pipeline group for the good of the bottom line.""

Welcome back! I had a great Easter with the exception of the bad news I received late Sunday night. My cousin (Renee') passed on Sunday around noon. She lived here in Houston. Her husband gave her and her baby AIDS. Her husband died some years ago. Her mom now has her little boy, who is close to Siera in age. My 2nd cousin (Kenny), who lives here in Houston also, lost his wife on Sunday around 2:30 pm. She was only 22 years old and they have a two year old daughter. This situation is really sad, because it stemed from a disagreement that was very petty. The Saturday before last, Kenny and his wife were on their way to Blockbuster. They were arguing over Kenny buying a DVD player. He stated that she was selfish when it came down to him spending $, etc... He told me that the next thing he knew, she jumped out of the moving car. He was going about 35 mph. She had bad head injuries and underwent two surgeries. She lived a week and one day. Her family is now blaming my cousin and they called the police on him at the hospital. The police had to escort my cousin and his family to their cars because her family was trying to fight him. Kenny's wife was responding when they brought her in to the hospital, and the police asked her if Kenny pushed her out of the car and she said no. It's a good thing they have this on record. I will most definitely keep your father in my prayers. I can't believe he's lost that much weight. He is blessed, and we're praying for God to heal him. We're praying for eternal remission right now in the name of Jesus! I know he was so happy to see you and his grandchildren. You all alone give him the strength to keep fighting. Church service was good on Sunday. Greg sho nuff preached! However, the choir didn't sound too good. Doren was out sick, so Gerald had to play and direct. It was aweful. We were all rocking different ways. No, we did not sing any of my songs. I only made the 11:00 service. Are you going to rehearsal tonight? Well, I did buy that cute dress from Lane Bryant with the shirt to match. I also bought the green print skirt with the green solid shirt and the pink solid shirt. Honey, I was a fox in that dress at the wedding on Saturday. I missed the wedding, but made the reception. When I walked in the room, all eyes were on me. For once, I didn't feel self conscious about my arms. My husband was all over me and giving me compliments. Several of his cousins told me how good I looked also. Steve wasn't too pleased about that. Have you worn those capri pants and spaghetti top that you bought? Write Back on 04/17/2001 12:41:36 PM cc: Hello, How was your weekend? My weekend was great visiting with my family. Everyone is doing fine. Daddy is doing okay. The radiation treatments put the prostate cancer in remission, although the Dr. said the cancer would just move to another part of his body. He thinks it may have moved to his leg, He had a MRI done last week, and today he will get the results, and he's so afraid he's going to need surgery again. He's has to use a walker to get around and he's lost so much weight, he probably went from 170 to l00. It's really sad, he is so small and frail. He's starting to get his appetite back somewhat. He sure had a good time eating this weekend. My sister and I threw down on Easter dinner. Please keep him in your prayers. It's so sad to see a vibrant man reduced to needing help in everything he does, but he's definitely a BLESSED MAN! How was church services on Sunday? Did you make it to all the services, (I don't even know why I'm asking, I know you didn't go to all of them, that's a bit much). Did Greg show out on Easter? Anything new going on with the choir, did you sing any of your songs. This month is going to be extremely busy with the revivial and the other church outing.

(""Morgan"") only Jay can answer your question Sent: Thursday, November 01, 2001 10:50 AM Jay and Tanya: Legal would like to speak with one of you about the ""Chase"" and ""Morgan"" issues surrounding the Master Netting Agreement requests. There seems to be some confusion. I think the Chase request came from credit and the Morgan request came directly from Morgan. The items below summarize what I know about the two different counterparties. (1) At the request of Chase and with Jay's approval, ENA terminated the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York Master Energy Price Swap Agreement. All outstanding trades have been transferred to the April 5, 1994 Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Agreement between The Chase Manhattan Bank and ENA (""the Chase Master). When the merger is complete (anticipated around November 10, 2001), the survivor JP Morgan Chase Bank will be ENA's counterparty under the Chase Master. [See Letter Agreement dated October 24, 2001] (2) The Chase Master has been amended several times, most recently to provide for FX forward trades and resolve multibranch issues. (3) Chase recently agreed that ENA propose a new ISDA Schedule/CSA. Legal has requested a credit worksheet. (4) Among other things, it appears that the Chase Master currently provides for First Method. This has never been amended. (5) The Chase Master is used for FX/rate and commodity trades. On a different note, (5) Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc. has signed ""mini-netting"" agreements with ECTRIC. Morgan now wants to sign similar ""mini-netting"" agreements with ERAC and EGLI. I believe that John Viverito is working on these agreements. Morgan is currently satisfied with its status with ENA but would like to see our Master Netting Agreement and may decide to execute. Three outstanding ELFI financial trades will be reconfirmed under ENA and I am waiting for Morgan to forward that documentation. (6) Both ENA and Enron Corp. have been in the process of negotiating ISDA agreements with Morgan Stanley Capital Services, Inc. Nothing has been executed. ECTRIC has an executed ISDA with that entity. (7) The names ""Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc."" and ""Morgan Stanley & Co. International Limited"" also appear in our database but you can check that out if necessary. QUESTION: The Master Netting Agreement assignment list contains the name ""J.P.Morgan"". Legal is waiting for direction from credit for preparation of the JP Morgan Chase Master Netting Agreement. QUESTION: Does credit also want to send a Master Netting Agreement to Morgan? Or should legal merely send Morgan a blank template to see if Morgan has any interest in executing such an agreement? Sorry for the length of this message but the word ""Morgan"" raises all kinds of questions. I hope this explanation helps to identify some of the issues for anyone involved.

Re: Pigging from P-2 to P-3,darrell.schoolcraft@enron.com,gary.spraggins@enron.com,"Wed, 13 Jun 2001 14:50:00 -0700 (PDT)",<10254038.1075852190172.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"I spoke to the guys in the field last week when our deliveries went up and we made the decision to run the pigs. It was passed on to us that the fluids in the line were heavies that were in the gas streams possibly coming from the Bitter Lakes and Red Bluff points. I had them pull moisture readings and they were well below TW's #7 of water. They said it was more like drip. This heavies are in the gas stream that is falling out and collecting in the pipe. I agree that we need to run pigs when we have the volumes. We in gas control will continue to work with the field to make that happen. If I have the wrong impression on what is happening I apologize. Please let me know. Thanks DS Gary Spraggins 06/13/2001 09:50 AM cc: Rich Randy, I agree we should continue to pig the line until the liquids have been cleared out then pig it on a regular basis. We would just have to work with Darrell Schoolcraft on TW operations and NNG operations to make it happen. Their may be days that it just does not work on one side or the other but once the line is cleared out of liquids we should be able to find a day on a bi-weekly or monthly basis to make it happen. We will work with you any way we can. Also, I'm sure it probably has already been looked into but is there anything that can be done as to the location the condensate is coming from or could something be done at P-2 to catch it before it goes up the Panhandle lateral. Gary Randy LeBeau 06/12/2001 05:46 PM cc: Rich Gary, we recently had to run a pig from P-2 to P-3 in order to push about 2200 barrels of condensate out of the line. We had started developing problems with some deliveries off that line. Apparently, in order to run a pig, some volume has to be routed to that line. I understand that there are some marketing and gas control issues when we do this, but here are some operational concerns when we have to put this off or postpone it: The condensate and fluids tend to build up to the point that they carry over to a delivery point with Energas. This point feeds some domestic customers. We don't want condensate getting into this point. There is a customer on this line (Owens-Corning) who gets fuel from us. Their process is very sensitive to pressure and volume changes. At any given time, I am told that they have about a million dollars worth of material in production. If they lose fuel, the product is lost and we could be liable. I am also told that once the plant goes down, it could take a long time (even weeks) to get it back up. The Owens-Corning plant does not have an agreement with anyone for alternate fuel. When the line has large amounts of condensate, we have been asking Energas to supply the plant until the pig passes the point. This is in order to prevent a slug of liquid from affecting the fuel pressure. The gas from Energas is NOT measured. They used to have the contract, but when we got it, they removed their meter setting. Apparently they agreed (verbally) to supply gas to the plant in March, for a few hours, when a pig was run. The plant uses about 3 mmcf/d and Energas was on for about 3 hours. I was notified today that Energas sent us a bill for the March pig run when we used their gas for fuel.....$21,000! Obviously we will negotiate that amount, but they have us at a disadvantage. I can only assume that we will receive a similar bill for using them last weekend for about 3 hours. Everyone feels that if we run a pig on a regular schedule, we would not get large condensate amounts into P-3 (which shuts us down, by the way), we would not have to use Energas, we would not risk pushing condensate into a delivery point, and we would not incur the overtime when this happens. I'm sure Rich has some concerns also for the portion of the line in his region. We would like to run another pig as soon as possible to see what is left in the line and then (depending on what we push into P-3) get on a regular schedule...possibly once a month. What do you think we can do to work something out? Thanks for any help you can give us. <Embedded StdOleLink>",Neutral,2001

I will need to find the document. It is my understanding that, with the exception of one deal, all the deals between ENA and MSCGI are firm deals of greater than one month duration. ENA uses the GISB for month or less firm deals and interruptible deals of any length as recommended by the Gas Industry Standards Board. For firm deals that are longer than one month, ENA uses a master firm agreement if one exists. If there is no master firm agreement, we send out our General Terms and Conditions with our confirmation. That answers your question of why Ellen sent our GTC when there is a GISB in place. It appears to me that you and I need to work on getting a master firm agreement in place. Please let me know your thoughts.

Ben told Henry that he was just heading out on vacation for a good portion of August (apparently, this is the practice for most of the GE senior executives since Welch has historically done the same thing for most of August), so he suggested touching base in early September. If you want, I could follow up around that time and then get back to you. As I noted in one of my prior e-mails, Henry thought you may want to also touch base on these types of issues with the Chief GE Transactional Counsel (and/or the Chief Litigation Counsel) and, if you wish to do that, Henry said he would be glad to make contact with either or both of them for you.

Perhaps the Buddha does not say that, but it's not a bad idea anyway. The Buddha would have said it, maybe, had he not been saying the other things. Our enemies can teach us lessons. Our adversaries can make us stronger. They can be consumed with greed and contempt, their very breath can be toxic, and yet their actions can open upward-flowing paths. Take Enron, the energy company, or Chevron, another energy company, or El Paso Natural Gas, yet another energy company. These organizations are the minions of Satan. They pillage and they profit. They are in the ascendant. Their enemies fall before them like cordwood. Ordinary citizens cower and meekly hand over tribute. And yet we thank them. We send our investigators after them and we pray that their executives land in jail, but we thank them. They have shown us the nature of our enslavement. They have defined the nature of our sloth. We have believed the Big Lie. We have believed in the free lunch. We have trusted those who would pander to us. We have eaten energy in great dripping gobs. Did we know it was not infinitely renewable? Oh yes. Did we understand that energy companies could create ""shortages"" whenever they wanted merely by closing plants for ""maintenance""? You bet we did. And did we confuse the energy companies with charitable organizations and/or alchemists able to repeal the laws of nature? We did not. But it was more convenient to forget those things, and so we did. We have busy lives. We must do the things we must do. The infrastructure is everywhere crumbling, and we are patching it up ourselves. We are paying bureaucrats with taxes, but the bureaucrats are inadequate, so now the spirit of volunteerism is much praised. Volunteers are people who do jobs that other people are being paid to do but don't. AND SOMEHOW, EVEN in a society as relentlessly materialistic as this one, we forgot about our own checking accounts. Already seduced by the idea that credit card debt is good clean fun, we decided to waste a lot of money using energy we didn't need. I'm not talking about using a washing machine instead of going down to the river and beating your clothes with small stones -- I'm talking about washing machines with quarter-full loads and settings far too powerful for the task at hand. Right? Lights burning in unoccupied rooms. Appliances plugged in but never used. We pay for it. We send our wonderful money straight to the largest villains in American commerce because we are too stupid to do anything else. You wonder why they have contempt for us. You wonder why Dick Cheney believes he can fool all of the people all of the time. Because he has. Look: Last week the secretary of commerce suggested means-testing Social Security -- that is, means-testing a pension plan. You gave us the money, we kept it for 40 years, now -- prove that you need it! Why did he suggest that? Because he can! Why did PG&E demand additional compensation for its executives, who are moral dimbulbs and social criminals under any fair definition? Because they can get away with it! They will get away with it! You watch! I AM NOT saying that we have no one to blame but ourselves. There are active villains, and there are people who allow villainy to occur. Everyone in a corrupt system is corrupt. The fools are the ones who don't end up with any extra money. We are the fools. If we understand our foolishness, we begin to be wise. We send lovely bread-and-butter notes to Enron -- once we were blind, but now we see. And we await developments, or create them.",Negative,2001

The West LB LC facility. Corp still has not formed a view on whether we can give the ""no material litigation"" rep. so we cannot revert to West LB. Apart from the ?55m potentially available from WLB, Enron Europe now have NO LC facilities available. This is hurting us. Even if the answer is negative, at least we could give WLB a clear answer and negotiate to draw down on the facility. 2. Wrongful trading comfort. The directors having taken independent advice and been told that some fairly low level comfort is needed from Houston, noise and nervousness is now growing at this end because it has not been forthcoming. I attach a draft which would suffice. Can we please talk about how we can get Jeff McMahon to send this to Michael Brown. 3.ICI Counterindemnities and TXU: I discussed these with Jeff Hodge yesterday. Do you need anything more from me on these? Thanks Mark Sent: 01 November 2001 21:49 Mark, Rob My apologies for adding to your burden at this difficult time. However hopefully this might clarify our discussions of yesterday and enable us all to move on quickly. Enron Europe and its directors are facing two related issues: 1. Continuing to trade The directors of EEL and its subsids have to be satisfied that there is a reasonable prospect of avoiding an insolvent liquidation. This is a fairly low hurdle to pass and, in our situation, calls made on Corp. for cash have been promptly met and we have read the news today of a new confirmed facility so we already have a fair degree of comfort. The directors meet with independent counsel tomorrow but I believe that they will probably come out of that session asking for nothing more than a confirmation, by email to say Michael Brown, but from the top - Jeff or Greg, of where they currently see things, ie a positive prognosis for the future. That piece of electronic paper should be enough to enable the directors to reasonably conclude that we are not hurtling into Chapt 11 and to continue to trade. It would also be very helpful if that email could confirm that Michael would be promptly informed if things took a downward turn. I would be happy to draft a note but wonder whether the best way of quickly putting this to bed might be for a conversation to be had with Jeff/Greg to see what they would be prepared to say. That could then be drafted up and sent over. 2. Filing accounts The directors of Enron Europe and its subsids cannot file accounts on a going concern basis unless they are comfortable they will have adequate funds in the medium term to run their businesses. The hurdle here is higher than in point 1 above as prospective cash shortages would require the accounts to be qualified long before the directors would have to stop trading under point 1 above. So more comfort will probably be required here, which could include further details of the new facility (drawdown conditions and maturity periods) and prospects for further facilities being signed. This would back up the usual support letter. I should add that we have not actually received this year the usual support letter from Corp. addressed to Enron Europe and its subsids. I don't know if it has been formally requested but we will definitely need to see that document this time around. Could you please point me in the right direction for that? We now have until the end of January to file the accounts so point 1 above is definitely the immediately crucial issue. We would however like to resolve the accounts issue as soon as possible. Perhaps we could liaise with Joel to get a letter drafted and then signed by Jeff or Greg? That's it. It really boils down to requiring a bit more information from Corp. There is absolutely no desire to cause problems here, just a desire to put in place the right pieces of information (which we are sure are out there but we need to collect them in) which will safeguard the European directors personally and enable them to move on from these concerns to the more pressing business of Q4.

He wants to come back after 2 months. My recommendation is to take him back. He left on good terms and is quite competent. I would also like to send a message to the group that the grass on the other side of the fence may look greener, but in reality it may be painted hay. ""The Return of Grant Masson"" would demonstrate that Enron offers best long-term growth opportunities (and that I am good manager). Grant would come back to his original VP position. Can we short-circuit the hiring procedures for a VP. Grant's body is still warm and we can just re-instate him in the original position instead of going through all the loops required to hire a VP.

First of all, I would like to say that all of the schedulers are performing at a high level, except for Hillary and Jan. We have formally addressed Hillary's performance problems, and he is on a schedule for improvement or he is out. We have informally addressed Jan's performance issues with her, and next week intend to formalize that also. That Jan makes more than anyone else in the group makes her situation quite critical in my eyes, because we are not getting a return on that investment. The rest of the group is paid based on lots of factors that you are already aware of, years of service, years in scheduling, level of performance, etc. In Stacey's particular case, I am recommending her for promotion at the end of the year, which will bump her pay scale up and make her pay more equitable with her job performance. Also, I intend to help smooth over other inequities through the bonus pool. In regards to Patti, I have recommended her for a bonus for her service during the rough time we've had when we were understaffed. Bob Superty has supported this, and the information you provided him this last week should help in that endeavour. Patti has had her pay increased this year after a salary survey was performed by our HR group. I would like to point out that Patti is pretty well paid for someone with her experience level. Also, Patti would move up in the pay scale if she is promoted to Manager. I am not sure what the exact plan is for Patti and myself as far as how that will go. I would like to say that I feel more comfortable being back as each day goes on, and am ready to make a move to trading anytime now if that is what you and Mike still want to do. As regards to the new hires: yes, we can hire more like these at these prices. We would love to have employees like Matt, and Ted and Shelly, especially at these prices. Patti did an excellent job hiring these individuals. We have already started the process of looking for more like these to start backfilling in for Hillary and Jan. We also need to hire more for establishing a bigger physical presence in the west. We probably need to sit down and go over with you and Mike as to what kind of plans you have for expanding the desk. Finally, I would like to bring up that Lucci has requested that the Denver office do all nominations for IM Denver deals. This has met stiff resistance in the past, and I do not know how ya'll feel about it, but I promised that I would bring it up.

The Committee has been assigned the task of examining issues related to commodity derivatives trading in Norway and to propose a concrete regulatory framework (currently financial commodity trading is not regulated in Norway) on 15 June next year at the latest. The background knowledge of the Committee members, representing different Norwegian interests, appeared to be quite shifting; while certain Committee members had in-depth knowledge of, for instance, EU capital requirements others revealed limited understanding of the functioning of the power markets. The Committee took a great interest in the two regulatory points that I brought up, the lack of recognition of close-out netting in Norway and the forthcoming implications of CAD2. The discussions sometimes were vivid, but I believe that we succeeded in getting most of our message through. The vice-chairman of the Committee (lawyer) invited us to render further comments in writing and said that he would return to us for further discussions when the drafting process was about to start next year.

ComEd dispute at FERC. Important for us in our physical business. Probably want the letter to be a little more specific on a monthly index v. an hourly. Also, what about the 400 kw size distinction, is this the right #? May want to talk with Jim Wood. Isn't the DST question also important? The ICC's decision will impact the need for a PPO. Jim Sent: Monday, October 29, 2001 4:18 PM Thanks Jim! I will talk with EWS. Last time I did they were indifferent between Cinergy and ComEd and because of the uncertainty, I thought it better not to commit to something until we get closer to the date and we have a better idea of what we want - also because what we want may change. It's more important at this point just to get the concept in front of the ICC. You are right on the parking, but in the event that when customers are off PPO and there is no monthly public index, I wanted to make absolutely sure we had an out. Good question. Harvill said that if we wait for a good functioning wholesale market it will take 25 years and they were not going to do that. I n the meeting I stated that the ICC should put more pressure on COmEd to fix the problems with the RTO, but I emphasized the imbalance issue. I agree that I could clarify the letter to say fix the imbalance problems and that would be perhaps an acceptable compromise to fixing the whole RTO. That would let us physically deliver. Janine Sent: Monday, October 29, 2001 3:50 PM Janine -- Good job. On the hourly market price index, until we have LMP dispatch, the best we can do is a public index. Let's not ask for too much. Just something we can hedge against. Can you talk with the EWS folks for the best index option??? Also, if the default is a monthly public index, why do the customer's need any ""parking""? They can move directly to the new option. What is your definition of ""functioning wholesale market""? Are we stating that unless an RTO is running, we can't get rid of the PPO? Maybe just resolve the Imbalance issue. More specifics would be helpful. Thanks, Jim Sent: Monday, October 29, 2001 3:42 PM The ICC Energy Committee held a meeting to discuss ComEd's proposal to drop the PPO. We argued that this should not be allowed until the wholesale market/delivery issues are dealt with because otherwise customers will have no choice but to return to ComEd at the higher bundled rate. The good news is that a rather lengthy discussion on this issue ensued as a result. The industrial customer group and Mid American Energy supported our views; however AES New Energy said that this was not a problem for them. We also commented that once the PPO goes away it should not be resurrected due to the uncertainty it would create in the market. ComEd responded that under the statute they can not offer to waive the PPO but could negotiate an arrangement on the CTC if approached by the customer. This would mean that we could negotiate on behalf of all our customers regarding the CTC. We have the opportunity to file comments to the Commissioners before the actual filing. A draft is attached. << File: Commissioner Terry Harvill.doc >> If you have any comments, please respond by the end of the week.",Neutral,2001

My comments are as follows: 1. Regarding the strikeout in Section 2 of the language concerning the obligations of Enron surviving termination, Tri-State is opposed to striking this. The information is not to be used at any time other than for the purpose set forth in the agreement, and the fact that Enron may cease to acquire new information should not relieve it of its obligation not to use information it has previously received for unintended purposes. We believe that language protects against that occurrence-and is consistent with the language in the last sentence of Section 5 as well. 2. Regarding Section 6, Tri-State is opposed to waiving consequential, punitive or exemplary damages because in our view, it is likely that many damages Tri-State would suffer as a result of a breach would not be direct or ordinary, but rather consequential. In addition, the right to recover punitive or exemplary damages is needed in our view to protect against blatant disregard for the terms of the agreement. We also believe that we should have three years to commence an action after termination. 3. Regarding Section 7(b), we believe Colorado law is appropriate since Tri-State is the party that would be bringing an action for breach and should have the benefit of doing so in accordance with the laws it is familiar with. Please feel free to call or e-mail me or Jere with a response. We are open to discussing these points, but do feel very strongly that our position is reasonable and appropriate.

In short, all DA customers, irrespective of whether they were taking from Edison at the time that Edison accrued the ""undercollection,"" would be ""responsible"" for paying. Which means DA customers would pay twice for power--once to their ESP and now, again, to Edison. Is this something that your clients care about? We care quite a bit. One of the big issues is whether there ought to be hearings on all of this, or whether Karl Wood ought to just be able to push rates around based on briefs only. We feel pretty strongly that hearings are required. One of our big concerns is that this will be the tip of the iceberg, i.e., Edison will continue on after this in an attempt to force all kinds of costs on customers.

I hope things are well on the island. Please pass along my regards to everyone. Sent: Thursday, May 10, 2001 11:09 AM Matt, Long time no hear, hope you're doing fine at the new company. Sorry to bother you with this issue again since I know Leo Sommaripa has contacted you already, so I'll be brief and to the point. We have been trying to save a copy of the Database on a CD-R so that we can give it to the client for their reference but some issues have come up which have to do with programming. Our intention is for the client to keep the database in the CD and to be able to access all the features in it so that there is no need for them to copy it unto a hard drive and possibly modify the data. Since by saving it unto a CD makes the database read-only, there's no problem with keeping the data on the disk intact, and we're even working on a disclaimer to paste on the database. The problem is that by making it into a read-only file, some commands have become disabled. Specifically, the buttons on the review form that access the compliance, operations, equipment, and staffing forms are not available through the read-only format. I ventured into the programming codes for the commands and found the following string on all four buttons: DoCmd.DoMenuItem acFormBar, acRecordsMenu, acSaveRecord, , acMenuVer70 I temporarily deleted that line from the programming codes for all four and so far have not had any problems with accessing all levels of the database in the CD. Now, I do not know exactly what that string does to the database but would much rather find a safer alternative if possible or at least know that the string is not a critical part of the process. If this is something that can be answered right off the bat I'd appreciate it, I realize that this is not a priority anymore so if its something that will consume a extended period of time, let me know and I will continue seraching through other channels. I guess this wasn't brief after all and I appreciate the time and effort. I can be emailed or I can make the arrangements to call you, whatever's better for you.

Ben, please let me know when things are ready; I can plan my trip accordingly. Thanks, Amitava EnronCredit.com is working on 3 main models --- the FMC model, the Placement model, and the Movement model. FMC Model : provides credit default swap price curves for 16 ratings with 33 industry offsets. Each day, this model takes the previous day's trader curves and adjusts them for the movement in Bloomberg yields and observed swap prices. Placement Model : uses linear regression to credit default swap prices using dummified ranges for Market Capitalization, Liquidity, KMV Score, etc. One main issue here is that the dataset is biased towards investment grade names. Alternate approaches looked at developing separate models for separate sunsets of names. Movement Model : provides an alert system for news. This is under development. Current involvement of Houston Research Group members is in the development/modifications of the Placement Model, especially in thinking through the various single vs multi model approaches. We can help in the brainstorming for better models for subsets. One main project right now is to get a separate model for subsidiaries, and to exclude subsidiary names from the main regression. Value-at-risk is based on historical variance-covariance approach. The portfolio model is under development. Agenda for Houston Research Group members : Once sufficient data is collected, start reviewing for potential analytic relationships. Get weekly updates from London, and provide feedback. Plan on a trip if the work warrants it, once the agenda is fairly well drawn out, and data is available for analysis.",Neutral,2001

However, if we are to maintain growth levels, we need to focus very closely on our cost base and create more efficiencies in the current round of Enron Corp. budget reviews. We are analysing much more closely exactly which businesses we derive our earnings from and concentrating our resources on those areas. We will be taking decisions to put some projects on the ""back burner""and reduce the scope of others. This will inevitably mean that we need to reduce our headcount both in commercial and commercial support groups as we seek to identify the best mix of skills to keep us on our earnings growth track. To this end we will be seeking to cut our headcount in Europe by between five and ten percent, but we will aim as far as possible to achieve this through a program of voluntary severance. Details of this program will be made available by Monday 8th October. We hope to complete this exercise and communicate the outcome as quickly as possible in October so that everyone knows where they stand. Please feel free to contact either of us, but also talk to your supervisor about any specific concerns you may have and remember that you can also make use of the LifeWorks confidential counselling service that is available on 0800 169 1920.

PSEG would like to negotiate and sign a binding LOI regarding the Kendall project site in Illinois prior to negotiating and executing the Definitive SPA. The specifics of this LOI are: PSEG would pay an up-front $300,000 payment to ENA This payment would be non-refundable unless PSEG discovered a ""fatal flaw"" in the project (we will have to carefully define this concept) The binding LOI would establish a date by which the SPA would be executed or PSEG would forfeit the up-front payment The $2.7 MM balance of the Purchase Price would be due upon closing (signing the SPA and transferring the member interests). I believe that PSEG is getting nervous that we may close on the Kendall LLC with another Buyer before they get their act together. Call me to discuss the timing of drafting such an LOI. I would like to strike on PSEG while they are anxious and motivated. My goal is to send the LOI to PSEG by Wednesday of this week.

However, it's a great place to learn operational logistics. The intent is that I'll be productive in the role immediately while learning the ropes. As they hire the needed full-time schedulers and I get up to speed, I'll move into market research for the traders. My first such assignment is to value storage in different markets based on historical gas pricing and injection-withdrawel strategies. Let's just say my plate looks to be full. By the way, I'm sure you saw the previous email from our buddy, Ted Bland. Looks like he got the message, although I'm still feeling like there's still some orientation regarding the A/A program itself that we're missing.

Bernadette called each of your assistants, so it should be on your calendars. As a brief update prior to our call: We have a phone call in to FERC to check on the procedural status of the merger. Donna Fulton, my colleague in Washington, has many contacts at FERC and is working with those people to learn what she can about the status of our proceeding. Joanne is supposed to be meeting with Bob Wasson at the SEC (along with Bill Weedon) early next week to get a sense of where the SEC is on the case. Per Rick's suggestion, I have asked another colleague of mine in Washington, Chris Long, to help us decide who would be the appropriate person to make contact at the SEC if we decide to make that contact. Chris is working with some political operatives on this. We have been working with Portland General and Sierra on their RTO filing. As you may recall, a commitment to join an RTO (Regional Transmission Organization) is one of the things FERC will require of the merging parties. An RTO filing will be made at FERC on October 23. While RTO progress has been good so far, Sierra and PGE have indicated that they may have concerns with the RTO they are working with (the Northwest RTO). We are working with Sierra and PGE to make sure that they do not do anything in the RTO proceeding that could cause concern for FERC regarding the companies' commitment to join an RTO. There was some question about the status of a temporary services company being created by the merged company. Joanne has been working with the Sierra and PGE people on this issue and does not see this as being a problem now, but I have asked her for confirmation that this ""alternative"" type of service company arrangement will not delay the SEC proceeding.

I appreciate the complement but I like my current job just fine--all I have to do is crap on a contract now and then and argue with Mary Kay all day long. Piece of cake! DF Steven Harris 06/19/2000 10:53 AM cc: Excellent questions! Are you sure you don't want a job in the Commercial Group? You talent as a deal maker is definitely underutilized. cc: William John M Bill Jerry D Arnold L Steven Lorraine Kevin Thanks for the extremely helpful analysis Steve and John. I'm getting a pretty clear sense that this project isn't going anywhere as it is currently configured. Just to satisfy myself, though, let me throw out a couple of observations for the group to react to, along the lines of Steve's ""However"" section of his memo: 1. Running this thing as a baseload unit won't work. The fuel cost is a killer. However, I keep thinking about the $200/mwh 4 Corners spot price someone mentioned on the phone. Is there enough volatility at 4 Corners to support a peaking merchant plant? How often are those types of opportunities available, and could a power plant in Alb. capture that upside by transporting power to 4 Corners over PNMs system? 2. We have been assuming that the power plant should be a baseload plant. Someone on the phone last week had some numbers indicating that the DOE/DOD electric load at Kirtland had a fairly high load factor. I think we have all assumed further that the plant should run at a high load factor to sell surplus power into the grid (either at 4 Corners or, after N.M. elec. restructuring, into the Alb. area). I just found the numbers I was remembering on the conf. call--1998 peak load was 63.6 mw, and total annual 1998 consumption was 334.5 million Kwh. By my lawyer-math, that is about a 60% load factor for DOE. If the DOE load is only 60% L.F., and the plant only generates surplus power when it can capture profit opportunities that arise when the market clearing price at 4 Corners or in Albuquerque exceeds some benchmark rate ($.05/Kwh? $.10/Kwh? higher?) the plant might run at a 30-40% load factor on an annual basis. The question is can we reduce the capital cost significantly by building a peaker instead of a baseload unit? 3. Could we get debt financing for a 140 mw plant that had a baseload demand charge contract for only 65 mw (i.e., DOE) but sold the rest of its output into the grid only when profit opportunities arose? 4. If the answer to 3. is no, would ENA backstop the debt financing by signing a demand charge contract for all surplus power over and above what the government needs? At what price? Based on its knowledge of volatility and profit opportunities currently available at 4 Corners, and future profit opportunities that will be available in Albuq. is that just a dumb bet, or would ENA get interested if someone else (i.e., DOE) split the risk and reward? John, how much of the information in your analysis could be sanitized in a way that we could provide it to Dennis Langley? If we pull the plug on the project, I'd like to be in a position that we could let him in on some of our information on why the turbines we would use can't provide acceptable economics. I don't expect that we'd want to disclose the swap value analysis in Steve's memo, however. Thanks again, and I'd appreciate anyone's reaction to the above questions. DF Stephen 06/16/2000 06:12 PM cc: John M Bill Jerry D Arnold L Steven Drew Lorraine John's proposed plant costs are consistent with what we have seen for our ongoing LM6000 development. I have priced 130 MW at Four Corners assuming Permian gas plus 50 cents for transport. This also assumes $4.70 per MWh for O&M and an 8000 heat rate. For an hourly 7x24 product, the intrinsic value of the gas-power swap is $52.5 million on a 20 year deal, well below the $108 million estimate of constructing the facility. A ten year swap is worth only $42 million (NPV = -66 m ). That implies a market mid-price of $34 per MWh levelized over the period. Using the ENA Power and Gas structuring model and curves, we can determine the following: 1. New build gas turbines cannot compete against the New Mexico market on price. 2. LM6000 CCGT efficiency gain does not pay for HRSG and ST over a ten year period. However: 1. Transmission constraints could create market value in Albuquerque that does not exist at Four Corners. 2. ENA's power prices typically undersell the market. 3. Commodity pricing does not accurately value capacity or reliability in constrained markets. If Enron wants to do a deal in Albuquerque, we should be selling capacity and reliability. Given the number of power- critical industries in the area, we could look at siting several remote units at different locations in the city. Numerous chip manufacturing facilities and the Kirtland base could support several LM6000's for power reliability that is specific to their installations. I might also suggest that peaking units would have advantages over CCGT units. Existing generation already provides ample baseload supply, however, the production of peak and intermediate energy is not necessarily well suited to existing units. LM6000's have exceptionally good ramp rates that provide real value to a utility customer. Not only can the HRSG/ST hinder the flexibility of the units, it can add substantial capital and operating expense with little real market benefit. We should also explore the ability to schedule load. If the DOE wants to peak for a test, would it be willing or able to schedule a test for the off-peak hours? Under those circumstances, we might be able to cut them a break on power and provide reliability of supply. Steve Thome 503-464-3708 John M 06/15/2000 06:53 PM cc: , Stephen Bill, Yesterday, we decided to look at two options for Pueblo; a 60 MW case and a 140 MW case. In order to match these outputs as closely as possible with available equipment, I made the following selections: Case 1 Equipment 3 X GE LM 2500 Gas Turbine Generators with Heat Recovery and 1 X 22 MW Steam Turbine Generator Output at 95 deg F & 5000 ft 67 MW Output at avg. conditions (60 deg F) 73.4 MW Heat Rate at avg. conditions 8170 Btu/kWh (HHV) Case 2 Equipment 3 X GE LM 6000 Gas Turbine Generators with Heat Recovery and 1 X 44 MW Steam Turbine Generator Output at 95 deg F & 5000 ft 130 MW Output at avg. conditions (60 deg F) 143.7 MW Heat Rate at avg. conditions 7900 Btu/kWh (HHV) There is a wide fluctuation in ambient temperature in Albuquerque and I sized the blocks based on 95 deg F but used the annual average output at 60 deg F for estimating power sales. I have attached files that show the build-up of the estimated EPC price for the plants. The required power prices are projected in a simple-minded economics file attached. The projections are based on: 70% debt financing at 10% rate. 10-year project and debt life. 8500 hours per year at average output (97% capacity factor). Gas at $4.40/MMBtu. The results turn out pretty much as anticipated. Even with the larger plant, we'd have to sell the power for over 6c/kWh.",Negative,2000

Sent: Friday, June 29, 2001 10:49 AM Kevin Today at the Commercial Practices Committee (SPP) we voted to accept the draft real time market design for the ""Day 2"" market (i.e. 12/15/02). This design, while not perfect, is in the direction of PJM. As such it provides a real time market (yes you will be able to go long/short 10,000MW in real time!), with no penalties and no balanced schedule requirement. Although control areas will be maintained, SPP will be the central dispatcher (the role of the control areas as of 12/15/02 has yet to be determined). Moreover, the SPP real time market will probably be implemented by MISO and is being looked at by GridSouth. Overall this is a pretty good outcome for both Enron and the market in general. On a different note, I provided Jim Steffes with my letter of resignation today. I don't know whether or not I will be back in the office so I wanted to express what a pleasure it has been to work with (for?) you and the desk - I am very grateful for the confidence that you have shown in me.

I have a meeting right now, and will focus on it right after that -- I'll send another email once I've completed that review early this afternoon. Michelle Hoyt 07/28/2000 11:23 AM cc: Jon David Michelle, Melissa Laing and I talked to Jon Chapman today, and basically Jon deferred to you, since the RW employees in NY are a question for US employment law. Melissa and I do believe that the RW US-based employees that were given UK-style employment letters, such as the sample one I gave you, are our employees, because of those letters; they were given ""offer letters"" by MG before the MG/Enron deal went unconditional and in most cases they accepted them, so they were MG employees when all MG employees became our employees. If it is a fact that they are Enron employees, we have to figure out the liability associated with terminating them! It appears that on Monday, MG and Enron leadership will decide to exit some of the London and New York RW business that MG acquired, and some (minimum 9, max 15) of the former RW employees will need to be terminated during August. John Sheriff and Gary Hickerson both want to know the cost of that decision. Right now we are assuming that we are liable for the severance periods stated in the offer letters to the people; we would like to be able to avoid that cost (estimated at $700k and $1.5M, depending on who is redundant) or reduce it if possible. However, if it is your recommendation that we have to honor those letters, so be it. If you have any questions, please call Melissa Laing (tie line 8303 6617) in the UK and she can find me. Thanks. Hoyt Michelle 07/28/2000 10:10 AM cc: Hoyt, I am convinced that the MG employees are ours. The RW employees may or may not be ours. It is my understanding that we own the assets of RW, and that we decided to hire certain, key personnel from RW. The remaining RW employees do not automatically come with the assets. I am working on obtaining more information on the RW side of things from lawyers here in the US. Key to employment decisions will be provisions of the asset purchase agreement, if any are applicable. You might check with Jon Chapman in the UK to see whether he has any more information on this point. Thanks. Michelle Hoyt 07/28/2000 04:12 AM cc: Justin Boyd said he talked to you, are you convinced that the MG and RW employees are now ours? Assuming that you do: I will bring copies of all the offer letters MG wrote to RW employees, I think there are something like 27 or 28. They are all very similar to the one or two that I have already given you. I believe that we will not want to keep some of the businesses that are being acquired with Rudolph Wolff, particularly the FX business in New York. Naturally, some of the people in the potentially discontinued business received the onerous letters. Gary Hickerson has to decide what he is going to do with this by August 18, if not sooner. With the letters that were delivered , I would like to get an opinion from you on what we have to do to terminate the people associated with the business, assuming that Gary wants to shut it down. Also, MG have 4 to 6 employees in Montreal. We (HR) are trying to convince the business side that we do not want any people in Montreal because of the employment laws . . . but it does not appear that we will succeed. We may reduce the size of the office, though, and we may not want to put them on the Canadian payroll, particularly is we only keep 1-2 people there. Do you have contacts in Montreal that can advise us on how to terminate any employees that we choose to terminate? What would be the Enron position on having them on a separate payroll from Enron Canada? Thanks Hoyt",Neutral,2000

It's also important to make sure that the feared event is included in the Market Disruption Event definition. I think this is the relevant language from the GTC: 7. Market Disruption. If a Market Disruption Event has occurred and is continuing on any Trading Day, the Floating Price for such Trading Day shall be determined pursuant to the Floating Price Source specified in this Transaction for the first Trading Day thereafter on which no Market Disruption Event exists; provided, however, if the Floating Price is not so determined within three Business Days after the first Trading Day on which the Market Disruption Event occurred or existed, then the Floating Price shall be determined by reference to the Alternative Floating Price Source specified in this Transaction, if any, which is not subject to a Market Disruption Event. If no Alternative Floating Price Source is available or has been specified, and the Market Disruption Event continues for more than three Business Days, then the parties shall negotiate in good faith to agree on a Floating Price (or a method for determining a Floating Price), and if the parties have not so agreed on or before the twelfth Business Day following the first Trading Day on which the Market Disruption Event occurred or existed, then the Floating Price shall be determined in good faith by Enron, by taking the average of two or more dealer quotes. ""Market Disruption Event"" means, with respect to a Floating Price Source, any of the following events (the existence of which shall be determined in good faith by Enron): (a) the failure of the Floating Price Source to announce or publish information necessary for determining the Floating Price; (b) the failure of trading to commence or the permanent discontinuation or material suspension of trading in the relevant futures contract, options contract or commodity on the exchange or market (e.g., NYMEX) acting as the Floating Price Source (the ""Exchange""); (c) the temporary or permanent discontinuance or unavailability of any relevant Floating Price Source; (d) the temporary or permanent closing of any Exchange acting as the Floating Price Source; (e) the imposition of trading limits by the Exchange such that there are limits on the range within which the price of the relevant commodity may fluctuate in the prompt month and the closing or settlement price of such commodity on such day is at the upper or lower limit of that range; (f) a material change in the formula for or the method of determining the Floating Price; or (g) a material change in the content, composition or constitution of the relevant commodity. Greg Johnston 11/10/2000 12:41 PM cc: Mark Further to John's e-mail below, I do not believe that we need to build this type of language for alternative settlement into the long descriptions for financial power products, as both the form of ISDA and the GTC that we use for confirming financial transactions (which contain the legal terms and conditions that will govern Canadian EOL financial power transactions) contain market disruption provisions. These market disruption provisions provide the mechanism for determining the index price if the referenced price is unavailable or there is a material change in the formula or calculation of the referenced price, etc. I am just waiting to confirm with Mark Taylor that the on-line form of GTC applicable to financial transactions is the same as for the form used for transactions not entered into through EOL.

The meeting has been positioned with the minister's office as a discussion forum around certain key fundamental topics (see points 1 to 4 below) If you would like to discuss other topics that interest your company please feel free to air these issues in the discussion. We are suggesting that everything discussed in this form is held ""off the record"" Directions: From Calgary, follow the Trans Canada Highway West to the first Banff exit (Banff/Lake Minnewanka sign). Turn left onto Banff Avenue and proceed towards downtown Banff. The Banff Rocky Mountain Resort is the first hotel on the left, at the corner of Banff Avenue and Tunnel Mountain Road. Business casual or golf attire Potential subjects, as relayed to the minister's office: 1. What is the Government planning to do with the Electricity market? Over the past 12 months intervention by the government and governmental agencies drastically affected the market for electricity. These actions caused dramatic sudden changes in forward market prices. The APMA members are concerned that this behavior (often given the idiom 'reactionary regulation') will persist. 2. What is the Governments view on transmission lines to the US markets? The prospect of transmission lines that would directly connect the Alberta market with US market is an interesting subject to most power marketers. What is the current position of the government on the how the building, owning and marketing of these hypothetical transmission lines would work in the new market? 3. What is the government planning to with the remaining unsold PPA? Last years decision by the Balancing Pool to sell energy from the unsold Power Purchase Arrangements in a single auction dramatically affected the forward market for electricity. With the balancing pool still the custodian of the unsold PPAs ? What is the plan going forward for the release of the unsold PPAs into the market.

Who are they hiring as lobbyists? Jim Sent: Thursday, November 01, 2001 8:14 AM Power Companies Unite to Lobby State; They Want to Build Power Plants in Florida But Not Sell Directly to Consumers. Sarasota Herald-Tribune ( November 01, 2001 ) To increase their lobbying clout, several of the nation's biggest independent power companies have formed a trade group focusing on Florida. The group, Partnership for Affordable Competitive Energy, will try to convince lawmakers to open Florida to companies like it that want to build power plants but not sell the electricity directly to consumers. Among the founding members are Calpine Corp., Competitive Power Ventures, Constellation Power, Duke Energy North America, PG&E National Energy Group and Reliant Energy. The announcement came a day before Gov. Jeb Bush's handpicked research group, the Energy 2020 Study Commission, was set to discuss its findings with the Legislature and recommend opening the state to so-called merchant power plants. Florida law prohibits companies from building power plants unless virtually all of the electricity is for use in Florida. Merchant power companies, however, make their money by selling power on the wholesale market to other power suppliers. Michael Green, Duke Energy vice president and PACE chairman, said a deregulated Florida wholesale market will lead to lower costs for consumers and more dependable energy supplies. Investor-owned utilities such as FPL Group and Florida Power Corp. counter that they make plenty of energy, and prices are already among the nation's lowest. Environmental groups worry that opening the nation to merchant plants might set off a spree of plant-building that could damage the environment. T he commission endorsed the idea of an open wholesale market last year, but the idea buckled amid the California energy crisis and under pressure from lobbyists for FPL and Florida Power Corp.

Recourse rate dilemma: the sequel,susan.scott@enron.com,maria.pavlou@enron.com,"Mon, 27 Nov 2000 10:28:00 -0800 (PST)",<26623197.1075846732318.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Maria and Drew, this is a long-winded e-mail but please bear with me... The problem: As you probably remember, several months ago several of us met to discuss the following language in the ROFR portion of Transwestern's tariff: ""if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate,"" and the additional frustrating language ""[a]ll available capacity shall be allocated under these procedures . . .."" At our last meeting, we concluded that probably the best way to ensure that TW could capture the true value of the capacity would be to link the negotiated rate to index prices. However, since this usually involves an unacceptable amount of risk to both the shipper and TW, the marketers haven't done any index-based rates and have no current plans to enter into any such deals. I have been asked by the Commercial Group to revisit this issue and to think of other ways we could increase our ability to charge more than the maximum rate. Ideally they would like to eliminate the language I've quoted above. However, my research has indicated that absent our 1) bringing about radical change in the way FERC thinks about recourse rates or 2) showing that TW lacks market power, we are probably stuck with this language. Why the problem exists (you may already know): Steve Stojic and I did some looking into why the language is in our tariff in the first place. In the Alternative Rates Policy Statement (RM95-6-000), the Commission explained that it is willing to entertain individual requests for negotiated rates, but only where customers retain the ability to choose a cost-of-service based tariff rates. ""[T]he availability of a recourse service would prevent pipelines from exercising market power by assuring that the customer can fall back to cost-based, traditional service if the pipeline unilaterally demands excessive prices or withholds service. Thus, the recourse rate mitigates market power."" The Commission went on to confirmed that under ROFR provisions the highest rate that an existing shipper must match if it wishes to continue its transportation arrangement is the maximum tariff rate. This policy is clearly not limited to ROFR situations: when capacity is constrained, a shipper willing to pay only the recourse rate cannot lose access to capacity merely because someone else is willing to pay a negotiated rate. ""When there are more requests for capacity than there is capacity available, then the pipeline must allocate capacity among those shippers willing to pay either the negotiated rate or the maximum recourse rate, for example on a pro rata basis if required by its tariff."" The example cited by the Commission: If a pipeline has 100 Dth/d available and two shippers request that capacity, one who is willing to pay no more than the recourse rate of $5 and another a negotiated rate of $6, then each would be allocated 50 Dth/d on a pro rata basis (assuming the tariff provided for pro rata allocation and not some other allocation method such as lottery). When TW filed for authority to charge negotiated rates, it voluntarily added the statement that ""if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate."" Presumably we had concluded that we needed to add this recourse rate related provision in order to receive negotiated rate authority. Solutions?? I would like to know whether you concur that changing our tariff language outright is probably out of the question. I feel as if I've really been chasing my tail here. I have owed Lindy an answer for some time now. But I keep coming back to our having to prove lack of market power (which, Drew, is where I believe you were headed when we talked about this in mid-October). Steve Harris has asked whether we can just start small and remove the recourse rate cap as to only a portion of our system. I think we would still have to show lack of market power in order to do this. Do you agree? Stojic warns that proving lack of market power is a lengthy and expensive proposition. Might be worth it to us, though. Another idea is to somehow provide shippers with an incentive to pay more than max rate. After all, we do have authority to charge negotiated rates. We've seen one instance in which one of our marketers was able to get more than max rates for IT space based on good customer relations alone. However, despite our wonderful relationships with most of our customers, it's unlikely we can pull this off with any consistency. We wondered whether we might be able to get more than max rates in the context of an auction procedure. But I just am not convinced we could get around the Commission's requirement that recourse rates be available. That requirement has not changed. Have either of you seen anything to the contrary? I would like to meet with you two, plus several others I have in mind, to discuss this, preferably early this week (Tues. or Wed.), but would like to discuss briefly with you first. Please call me so we can talk for a few minutes. Thanks.",Neutral,2000

Order the CA PUC to create a separate rate component to cover the Dept.'s cost of purchasing the power. Authorize the Treasurer to issue debt, backed by ratepayers, to cover any difference between the price the Water Dept. buys the power for and the price that can be collected from ratepayers under the rate freeze. Authorizes the State Director of Finance to ""accept on behalf of the state any tangible asset of an electrical corporation."" (Presumably the state is looking to get something from the IOUs (say, the hydro assets) in exchange for giving the utility it's ""net undercollected amount."" The bill is long and haven't yet had a chance to review it in detail. We're faxing the bill. The bill will be controversial and it is unclear who in the Legislature has bought into it, though the Governor signaled his general support for this sort of approach in a press conference last night announcing the results of the power auction. The Assembly is scheduled to have a hearing on the bill later today. Will pass on more info as we get it. Jeff",Neutral,2001

Thank you. Jim Sent: Monday, March 26, 2001 12:15 PM A number of pieces of on going litigation and arbitration being conducted on behalf of EML and EMC have very recently come to our attention which we summarise below. We have endeavoured to establish the detail of these cases as quickly as possible, but in some instances await information from outside counsel involved. The summary is therefore necessarily provisional, and will need to be supplemented. There are in addition other claims of which we have been made aware, largely being run by MG Hong Kong and Beijing offices. Details are presently so sketchy that we have not included them until we have been able to verify. A supplementary note on these will follow asap. 1. Corporacion Nacional del Cobre de Chile (""Codelco"" ) v. MG Ltd, MGAG and MGCC This is a major, and very serious claim being brought by the Chilean state copper trading company Codelco against, primarily MG AG of Frankfurt, but also against MG Ltd (now Enron Metals Ltd) for recission of futures contracts on the basis that they were procured by fraud (a bribe of US$1.5m paid to the main Codelco trader by MGAG). We have received a brief summary of the claim from Slaughter & May, the lawyers handling the litigation on behalf of EML, which is attached below. As a result of an indemnity from MG AG, MG Ltd has NO financial exposure other than a credit risk to MG AG. Legal professional privilege must of course be maintained for this document and its contents, and any dissemination outside the legal dept should be made subject to prior approval by legal. Trial is set down in the Chancery Division of the High Court in London for 5-6 weeks, commencing October 2001. Significantly, and as you will be aware, High Court proceedings take place in public. - LT0108100843.doc 2. MG Ltd v. China Resources National Corporation Claim in LME arbitration for payment of US$6m futures losses on client contracts. Award published in favour of MGL on liability alone in August 2000. Damages to be assessed. Thereafter Award to be enforced in China. Solicitors: Clyde & Co. 3. MG Ltd v. London Clearing House Claim in LME arbitration for delivery of defective tin under warrant. Losses believed to be US$800,000. 7 day time bar defence run by the LCH heard as preliminary issue. Award in approx Feb 2000 in favour of MG (ie time bar inapplicable). This has led to resumption of settlement negotiations with Standard Chartered Bank (trading), who put the metal onto warrant originally (and against whom the LCH would have an indemnity claim). The most recent offer from Standard Chartered is to pay US$437,000; but this is subject to unacceptable conditions. Solicitors: Allen & Overy. 4. Nickel explosion in furnace in Cleveland: Scandia Transport LMEWarehouse/LCH/EMC/Phoenix /EAC/ Cast Alloys (smelter) Contaminated nickel supplied by EMC into the US. Amount of loss being established now. Incident much less bad than initial reports suggested, and have therefore deferred explosion survey/investigation lined up on urgent basis earlier this week. Expect indemnity claim to be brought against EMC by Phoenixx in LME arbitration; and to pass same claim on to the LCH. Assume possibility of US tort claim also lying direct from Smelter to EMC (awaiting advice from Limor Nissan/Andy Edison on this). Facts should become sufficiently clear to enable rough quantification within next week (w/c 26/3). NB. Other similarly contaminated shipments from the same warehouse are known to exist. Warnings to other customers are being prepared. 5. LME arbitration: Chinese receiver/ICD/Brandeis/EMC/EML/LCH/Warehouse Claim brought by Chinese receivers for supply of defective nickel on LME warrant bought through London clearing. Only US$62,000 claim, but involves significant point of principle, hence decision taken to proceed in arbitration. Should in principle be able to pass on incoming claim to LCH (and beyond). Expect unrecoverable costs (internal and external) to exceed the amount of the claim. Solicitors to be instructed w/c 26/3.",Neutral,2001

You told me that we were to act as first-chair trial counsel in this matter, and instructed me to retain local counsel immediately. On the recommendation of Susman & Godfrey and Willy Wood of Fulbright & Jaworski, and with Jim Derrick's authority, I am happy to report that I have retained Lazaro Garza-Gongora of Laredo as local counsel for us in this matter, at his usual hourly rate of $175, and a retainer of $5,000, to be applied by him against his fees and expenses. By acting quickly on this, we eliminated the risk of the remaining defendants snapping up all available local counsel and being forced to beg for a share of one. I would of course be willing to consider sharing Lazaro (and his fees) with other defendants, but with the understanding that in the event of a conflict, Lazaro would only represent us, and would be allowed to stay in the case. I anticipate that there will be a comprehensive joint defense agreement in this matter and that both local counsel and experts, including gas measurement experts, may be shared. I will be speaking with you shortly about retaining a gas measurement expert. Lazaro is going to the courthouse to review the court's file and will report shortly on what he finds.

Sent: Friday, July 13, 2001 9:44 AM Attendees Lynn Blair Steve January Hasan Kewdaii Joanne Bisbee Jeff may Mike Sullivan A representative with Cedar Falls Utility contacted the NNG measurement desk about volumes for the current gas day changing on the Operator Confirmation Summary. Issue: The daily PGas extract is including partial volume with an Incomplete flag for the current gas day (not closed). The MIPS extract did not process current gas day volumes. The Operator Confirmation Summary in TMS displays the incomplete volume to the TMS scheduler and to external customers thus impacting the imbalance calculation. Possible Solution: 1. Hold the data pole file until gas day is complete 2. Modify downstream system to process the incomplete flag to ignore current day volumes 3. Modify the PGas extract so that current day volume will not be included. Solution: PGas IT staff will modify the PGas extract so that current day (non closed) volumes will no longer be included in the file. This will make the extract identical to the MIPS daily extract file it replaces. TMS IT staff will modify the Operator Confirmation Summary in TMS to display the flow codes included in the extract. The flow codes are as follows: Blank = Complete record I = Incomplete record = Complete but edited record Mike Sullivan with provide a work plan and implantation date.

We hunted near a small town called Rio Tercero about 45 minutes outside of Cordoba. We stayed at the Los Alamos Lodge. Our guide's name was Sergio Abrile. We paid $750 for 3 days of hunting, 2 nights lodging, meals, hunting license, etc. We paid $9.00/box for shells. We aleady had our guns, however they had very nice, new Beretta 12/20 ga. shotguns for rent for $25/day. We hunted April 30-May 2 which is the end of fall and we slayed the birds. I think the only time to avoid is during the heart of winter July-August due to cold/wet conditions. The flight from Buenos Aires to Corboda cost about $200 and takes about an hour. You might call Emilio just to compare prices, etc. I think he is affiliated with a US outfitter called Gage/4 Seasons. I hope this info is helpful. Don't hesitate to call if have nay questions.

Scott was thinking they hunted in May (he is going to check) and had as much shooting (and then some) as he needed. 3) Accommodations in BA and where you hunt. Again he is going to verify and get some phone numbers but you want to stay close to where you are hunting (not like Mexico) and there are some very nice places - he is thinking he stayed at the Gauge Four Seasons.

Pawpaw and I met with an outfitter last week to discuss details of a dove hunting trip in Argentina. In a nutshell, the trip includes six (6) shoots (i.e. half day hunts) near the town of Cordoba, Argentina. As Jody can attest, there is no limit and you can shoot 400 to 1000 birds per day depending on how mad you are at them! I have estimated the total cost of the trip at $5,000. This price includes the following: 3 nights & 4 days (6 shoots) @ $2,295 (at Presidential Estancia) Roundtrip airfare (Houston-Miami-Buenos Aires-Cordoba) @ $1,000 (could be as low as $800) Shells ($9.75 per box) @ $1,000 (based on 320 birds per shoot...75% kill average) Gun permits, bird boys, entertainment in Buenos Aires, etc. @ $705 We need at least 4 to book a separate trip. Argentina's seasons are opposite from ours and the best time to go is August - October. A smaller group will be booked to go with an other group. I know all of you boys got huge 2000 bonuses...so what's a paltry $5 large for a trip like this? Let me know if you are interested in going with us so we can start looking at dates.

I also feel like Daddy feels real good that you are stepping in as well. I spoke with Mom yesterday, daddy was sleep, so she really got a chance to tell me how everything really is. She too is now saying that Daddy is in pretty bad shape. I asked Daddy about the retirement, and he said the same thing, he is not ready yet. but the reality of it is, is that we still need to move now and not wait. I just hope he understands. I'm glad Daddy is not in alot of pain. I think with him seeing the boys will really cheer him up. It's so hard to face all of this uncertainty isn't it. The good part, if there is any, is that Daddy is going to a better place with no more suffering. He's certainly had a good life and we all want him to go on forever, but if there is pain involved, I 'd rather see him out of pain. Just keep praying for Daddy as well as Mom.

I have graduation tonight so I will probably be home late. The visiting nurse came out last night to check on daddy and to explain how to use the feeding tube. I went over there around 9:00p.m. from church. After she fed daddy thru the tube, he upchuck again. So this tells all of us that the feeding tube is not going to do the job. The main concern that is being expressed by everyone is we have to find some way to stop the vomiting. The Hospice nurse will be out today at 4:00 and I go back over there to hear what they have to say. Daddy goes to the new doctors on May 31. The main concern is the vomiting. We just have to hang in there and keep praying. After my doctor's visit with Daddy on Thursday, I had a hard time dealing with it on Friday. Everytime someone would ask me about it, I would start crying. I am doing better today and daddy's spirit seemed fine last night. I told Junior about the nurses on Saturday and I left it up to him to talk with Corey. The next thing I need to do is call Daddy's boss and ask him about his retirement. Even though he is eligible, he is not ready to take that final step. when junior and I were talking, we wondered about what would happen to the retirement (as far as Mom is concerned) if he does not officially retire? Daddy is still very optimistic as we all are. It is very important that his attitude stays positive. Enough for now. Talk with you later.

So little C.J. looks like a ""half-breed"", (that's what you''re trying to say!). Is he cute? I can't wait to see him. Yes, I did talk to Teena yesterday afternoon, she sounded happy. I spoke with Daddy yesterday and told him to sit his butt down and stop trying to go to work, especially if there are no health benefits that he will be losing. Instead of concentrating on that job, I told him to concentrate on his health. He said I was right, and said he was going to seriously consider it. I had to laugh when he said he went to work and fell asleep reading or trying to throw away some paperwork. That was hilarious. Can you imagine the secretary going in and finding ""little bitty"" daddy sitting there asleep. I cracked up. The concert was good, you know those young men ""showed out"". However, the concert was supposed to start at 8 and did not start til 9 and had several acts before them and as a result, did not get out of the concert until 1:15 p.m. I was a tired sister, but it was well worth it.

Fernley has decided that it is too hard to write down all of the organizational changes and how it affects all of the people who reported in to Phillip and I, so he has just verbally announced the changes. But, at any rate, the word is getting out. I hadn't seen Mo in months, so it was good to catch up. I think she is headed to Houston this week (so is Frank) so I am sure you will be hearing from her. I have tentatively blocked out the week beginning Monday, Nov. 13th to come over to Houston, and would like to spend some of that time with you and your team, meeting people, and maybe just following you around for the day, as you suggested. Does that week work for you? I think the Management conference is later in the month, so people will generally be around. Please let me know, and I will make sure it happens. I will also need to spend some time with Melissa Becker and her team working on Post ASE Reporting solutions, but will plan to spend a significant amount of time with the North America group.

I will keep you posted. Thanks Anne Sent: Tuesday, October 02, 2001 1:54 PM How is this issue? Sent: Wednesday, September 19, 2001 7:15 PM I will set up a meeting with settlements to make sure that everything looks good from their end, and to clarify the payments that are made. I also need to meet with volume management to emphasize how the volumes should be allocated when the actuals arrive from the pipeline statements. I think that Daniel has the scheduling issues under control. Jason, Daniel, and I worked to get everything straight for September. October will not be much different. The only exception for October is that we do not have any third party gas coming from Enron, only BP. This actually makes life easier. As soon as I meet with the 2 back offices groups, I will report what I learned. Based on my meetings with settlements during July's process, I am confident that the deal is booked as well as the system can handle. However, checking and double checking the processes will not hurt. I will schedule something with you and Kim after my other meetings. Hopefully next week. Imbalances for Rockies and Citizens - I will let you know. We just finished cleaning up the SOCAL imbalances. We are clear through June as far as P/L is concerned. I think Matt Smith was working on July. We did have some old issues to clean up as the process was passed from Kim O. to Jane, but we have worked through the problems. Thanks for the note on the group. I am holding a learning lunch tomorrow. I want to make sure that our processes are as tight as possible, especially since bid-week is coming up. We have a good method for checking that all of the failed desk to desk deals are booked correctly, so it should go more smoothly. It will still be slow. Also, Randy Bhatia is working with EOL on resolving their logic issues. We are working towards a solution that will get the deals booked automatically. I will let you know the time line soon. I have a question. What does the ""Wood"" report mean ? See you. Anne Sent: Tuesday, September 18, 2001 8:51 PM Disregard attachments. How does the system know not to pay Palo for the gas daily deal at malin? You did this because gas daily will not show up as risk and Kim puts together a manual invoice and will not pay them for the third party supply? I want this deal to flow in the event Kim decides to travel the world. Please set up another meeting to discuss this deal. i will never understand. is it just me? Also, i still need to clean up imbalance deals from July with citizens and in the rockies. By the way, you are doing a great job. It seems like your group is getting their books run early. Also, have you ever talked to your group about secrecy and the fact that we never tell anyone in the market about P&L and/or positions. Just a reminder. You may want to talk to them about confidentiality. You never know who has a roommate from college at El Paso or Dynegy. Right? Sent: Tue 9/18/2001 3:56 PM Mike: Am I supposed to do something with the attachments ? They did not transfer through on the e-mail you forwarded. Kim has never given me any additional information regarding the loads. All we did on this deal recently was book the newest fixed price deal at Malin, and book the BP volumes (3rd party deals) that have been projected at Malin. On the BP gas: ..... We book a deal in which ENA purchases gas from Palo Alto at Gas Daily flat. Daniel Schedules the gas on the transport directly from BP. We enter the purchase in our system to show that you have 1,500 mmbtu/day at Malin that must be put on the transport to City Gate. We have not rebooked the origination. I am still using the estimated burns that were given to me at the inception of the deal. Let me know if this clears everything up. Thanks Anne Sent: Tuesday, September 18, 2001 2:52 PM Will show me how this deal and the orig was rebooked? Also, please show me how the third party deals were booked.

Sent: Wednesday, November 07, 2001 4:07 PM I was very disappointed to not have any advance warning about the announcement that construction on 41 has been put on hold for financial reasons. The Gas Logistics team was ""relocated"" off the 41st floor on October 5. Prior to the move, we had a very efficient, open configuration that let us work together as a unified team. After the move, we are located on 3 different floors. Besides the general impact on team unity, this move also means that our evening staff work alone on separate floors, rather than in a group. It means fewer individuals to cover customer calls. It means having more equipment to cover the day to day business. I have worked hard to calm the team that this arrangement is just temporary and that we will eventually be put back together as a team. Prior to our move I constantly questioned whether our move was necessary. I asked about smaller, more practical changes to fit more people on the floor. And, I specifically asked about whether Enron issues might impact the groups desire to continue to spend $7-$10 million -- even as I reluctantly packed up my boxes. I hope you can appreciate that the current seating arrangement is a serious issue for my team and one that generates constant questions as my staff meetings. Finding out that we moved off of 41 for no reason at an all-employee floor meeting undermines my team's faith in my leadership.",Negative,2001

Stephanie is checking with Transwestern to see what their parking/lending fees would be for weekends, just for an idea. I am also talking to the desk. I will keep you posted. Kim cc: Kim: Please review and add anything you want and return. C John/Sean: A few thoughts on the Griffith deal: 1. Term: PPL indicates they want to do the deal through 2003. That is really 2003 - 2004 as it incldues Nov - Mar. Extension until this time might require extension of our underlying deal. This would be OK with us. 2. Character of service: The text indicates that PPL would have the right to request deliveries be made to an alternqate point on TW. Why would they want this? This could be a problem if we know the gas wouldn't flow as we would shut in puchases. We would like to make this on a mutually acceptable basis. 3. Pricing: Does the reservation cahrge include variable transport? I think that is what we proposed. If not, then the Commodity rate flow needs to include the variable cost of transport plus fuel. 4. Conditions: Noms must be in at 8:00 am. This is very important and the a deal killer. We need time to manage the position. Also, the weekend issue needs to be addressed. As we have discussed, weekends trade as the same quantity each day. If they want to vary the daily amoount during the weekend and make Sunday higher than Sat or Monday, that is fairly ewaasy to deal with. If they want to have lower takes on Sunday, this is more difficult ad increases costs. We might be able to craft a solution to this however. Chris Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

Sorry Grayson is being a crybaby. It is tough being a baby, I think. How did the doctor's app't go? Bet you are ready for the weekend so Jim'll be around all day. Every working mom I know could not wait to get back to the office after maternity leave. I think the daycare arrangement is generally best for everyone. Baby gets a head start on her social life, and the parents can't wait to see the kid at the end of the work day! Most everyone I know is raising their kids that way, and they seem to be turning out fine. Even the handful of stay-at-home moms I've met leave their kids with someone several days a week, for sanity's sake. Had lunch with Mema on Wednesday at Treebeards. I get the impression that she's gotten the message that you and Jim don't exactly want her dropping in for spontaneous visits, so that's good. I always enjoy meeting her for lunch--for some reason she's always on best behavior, and we always run into my coworkers and friends who just think she's the greatest. Thank God she can never remember their names, or she might start calling them for lunch. Bill and I saw a play at Diverse Works last night called ""Fucking A."" It was a take-off on The Scarlet Letter. I thought it would be funnier but it was actually pretty dark. The bearer of the letter A was an abortionist in a strange land working to pay her son's way out of jail. Despite the subject matter it was one of the best plays I've seen in a very long time. Diverse Works is an art space in the warehouse district directly north of downtown. (Nancy Littlejohn (Worthington) has her art gallery nearby.) They mostly sponsor dance, dramatic and performance art productions. A lot of it is really over the top, but I've seen some cool things there. One of my friends at work is trying to get me to serve on the board of directors, so I've been hanging out there to see whether I like the people. Work is driving me nuts, but that's what they pay me for, I guess. Time to read more FERC cases. I don't wanna FERC, I just want to bang on the drum all day.

The four signed an agreement not to ""participate in any lawsuit (or) regulatory challenge"" that might slow or stop the project in exchange for a financial concession: $1 million from Duke for environmental ""monitoring and research."" Balancing power generation and environmental protection always has been difficult. But today, as power-starved California scrambles to find and permit new energy sources, some fear the Moss Landing agreement shows that money can sway even environmentalists -- and tip the scales too far in favor of economic development. Environmentalists who signed the agreement, though, said that despite their concerns about the plant expansion, they had little chance of stopping it, especially after it was approved by the California Energy Commission and Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board. So they took the potentially controversial step: entering into an agreement with Duke for financial resources to pay for studies of the plant's impact on the marine environment. Other environmentalists, though, criticized that approach. Duke Energy's efforts to modernize the Moss Landing Power Plant resulted in mitigation payments to environmental and other groups, including: $7 million to the Elkhorn Slough Foundation to mitigate the plant's use of seawater. $425,000 to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation over three years to monitor heated seawater discharge in the ocean. $1 million to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation over five years to monitor water quality through a program sponsored by Save Our Shores, the Center for Marine Conservation, the Friends of the Sea Otter and the Otter Project. $100,000 to the Marine Mammal Center to relocate its triage center for injured animals onto power plant property. $3.4 million to the Moss Landing Chamber of Commerce over 20 years for infrastructure improvements in the Moss Landing community. $100,000 to design and construct a boardwalk for additional beach access in Moss Landing. $60,000 for an environmental assessment for a proposed Elkhorn Slough Circle Trail. If approved, Duke would provide an additional $250,000 endowment to maintain the trail. ""It is very disheartening,"" said Carolyn Nielson, a retired teacher who along with some other local residents is waging a battle against what they consider an environmentally harmful power plant cooling system. ""These environmental groups have the expertise, the biologists, the attorneys,"" said Nielson, who has taken her case to the State Water Resources Control Board. ""We could have been much more successful with their help. But there wouldn't have been any financial reward in it for them."" Such criticisms are off-base, according to Warner Chabot, regional director for the Center for Marine Conservation, a national environmental group that was among those to sign the deal. He said environmentalists got the best deal possible in the current energy climate. ""Look at what's happening with power plant approvals in California right now,"" said Chabot, referring to the state's push to bring new energy sources on line. The Moss Landing project -- which is scheduled to add 1,060 megawatts in 2002, enough to serve one million homes -- is a key part of that energy expansion plan. No money will go to the four environmental groups -- the Center for Marine Conservation, along with Save Our Shores, Friends of the Sea Otter and the Otter Project. It will be routed, in five yearly installments of $200,000 each, to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation, a nonprofit organization that helps support sanctuary programs, including scientific research. Chabot helped found the sanctuary foundation and sits on its board. He said the money will be used to monitor the health of Elkhorn Slough, a biologically rich estuary that borders the plant and is linked to Monterey Bay. ""Not a dime comes to the Center for Marine Conservation,"" he said. ""Not a penny comes to me."" Duke representatives said the controversy about the arrangement has been stirred by a handful of people. ""It's a million dollars worth of water quality studies,"" said Duke spokesman Tom Williams. ""Our whole effort wasn't to try to buy anybody off. It was designed to help increase people's comfort level where there wasn't a comfort level."" The $1 million agreement signed in November is part of a package of more than $12 million in Duke payments to civil, government and environmental groups in connection with the plant modernization. The heftiest award -- $7 million to the Elkhorn Slough Foundation, a nonprofit environmental organization -- was negotiated by state agencies to ""mitigate"" environmental impacts of the plant. Formed in 1982, the slough foundation exists to promote ""the wise use and conservation of Elkhorn Slough and surrounding wetlands,"" its Web site says. However, some environmentalists say the state-approved mitigation plan is inadequate. ""If you want to say, 'Who did Duke roll with a big chunk of money?' I would say they rolled the California Energy Commission and the Regional Water Board for the price of mitigation,"" Chabot said. ""The agencies got bought off cheap. And the environment got taken to the cleaners."" Duke's Williams strongly disagreed. Environmental mitigation ""must be based on science, not on buying anybody off,"" he said. ""That is inappropriate, and we would not participate in that. ""That suggestion is offensive to us. And it should be offensive to any environmentalist."" Bob Haussler, head of the Energy Commission's environmental protection office, said the mitigation plan is biologically sound. ""We are confident it will improve the slough ecosystem,"" he said. Madeline Clark, a local businesswoman and founder of Monterey Parkway -- a citizens group that scrutinizes local public works projects -- called the recipients of Duke's payments a ""shopping list"" of government agencies, environmental groups and civic organizations. She was particularly critical of the $1 million deal with environmental groups. ""You know what bothers me?"" Clark said. ""Environmental groups get tons of donations. Their purpose is to protect and defend the environment. If a big corporation like Duke can come in and buy them off, I have a real problem with that."" Construction began in November on Duke's project to add 1,060 megawatts of natural gas-fired electrical capacity to the Moss Landing plant, purchased from PG&E in 1998. If the expansion is finished next year, as scheduled, it would account for more than 30 percent of all new generation in California in 2002. ""This is a big deal,"" said Williams, the Duke spokesman. ""It will be the largest plant in California. If that plant is delayed a month or two, we lose the summer of 2002. And that affects not only Duke Energy, but the state of California."" Opponents say it's not the power they oppose, but the plant's cooling system, which will pump about 1.2 billion gallons of seawater each day from Moss Landing Harbor. Such pumping, they say, will degrade Elkhorn Slough. They argue for an alternative cooling system, such as towers that re-circulate water. ""Basically, what that plant will do is take 25 percent of the volume of the harbor and slough, run it through a pipe and dump it back into the ocean with much of the marine life cooked and dead,"" said Steve Shimek, executive director of the Otter Project. For Shimek and other environmentalists, scientific studies commissioned by Duke during the permitting process left key questions unanswered about the plant's impact on the environment. ""There was no scientific evidence that would literally point to Duke causing harm to the environment,"" said Vicki Nichols, executive director of Save Our Shores. ""We felt we didn't have strong standing to sue."" Instead, the environmentalists began negotiating with Duke for financial payments for studies of environmental impacts of the modernization project. The process ""gave me tremendous pause and great concern,"" Nichols said. ""I knew there was going to be some perception that we were doing the wrong thing."" She was right. ""As far as I'm concerned, with the price-gouging going on by the energy wholesalers, they are just receiving stolen goods,"" said Clark, of the citizens group. Her skepticism was sharpened by the recent disclosure that Duke Energy approached Gov. Gray Davis with a secret deal offering financial concessions if the state dropped lawsuits and investigations into the power generator. Chabot, with the Center for Marine Conservation, discouraged any comparison between the two offers, calling it ""grossly unfair and inaccurate."" Regardless of what was intended with the payments, Nielson said they stain the process. ""It is so destructive in terms of making everyone cynical,"" she said. Shimek took a different view. ""We convinced Duke to spend $1 million toward monitoring that, frankly, five years from now could very well come back to haunt them,"" he said. ""Did we do the right thing? I have no idea. Did we try our best? Yes, we did.""",Neutral,2001

Our current position (after discussions about a month ago) has been that we are concerned about filing anything in the 637 docket because it would stir-up segmentation and for now we want to let that sleeping dog lie. We discussed again the possibility of making a separate tariff filing to pursue our OBA ""wish list"" outside the 637 arena and decided again that this type of filing would just get consolidated with our pending 637 filing. After further discussion we decided that the one thing, most narrowly defined, that would really help us out with our imbalances is mandatory cash-out in constrained areas. If defined this narrowly, this is something for which we can clearly demonstrate an operational need based upon historical allocation and imbalance data. We think that we could make a 30 day tariff filing for this one change and have minimum risk of entanglement with the overall 637 filing. Glen & Mary are going to discuss with MKM and Teb with Rob. Lyn & Terry are going to pull together the last 12 months of data for constrained areas on our pipe (Ignacio to Blanco, Blanco to Thoreau, Thoreau to the border & check with Darrell for any other areas that should be included) and increased imbalance levels. We plan to get together next week to discuss further. Concerning the rest of our OBA ""wish list"", we are discussing whether to hold meetings with individual protestors to discuss only the Imbalance issues of the filing and work toward a ""settlement"" position on those issues to have ready in the event of Commission action in this docket.",Neutral,2001

Warren offered to try and fly into Singapore this weekend to meet the 3 of us but I told Julia that I'd have to confer with you first when Houston opens today. However, following that conversation, Julia's note (see below) came in. Seeing that Warren will be in your 'vicinity' next month - it certainly makes far more sense for him to wend his way to Houston in February so I shall tell Julia to shelve Warren's initial offer to fly into Singapore this weekend.

Sent: Thursday, November 01, 2001 5:36 PM Hello Tracy, I wanted to share some conversations that I've had with both Demetrics and Hoang this week related to the project. On of the biggest issue seems to be with resources. I know that you guys have been quite busy with your planning process but it has been very difficult to get the required information or time from the resources that are committed to the project. This is due to the fact that they currently have a heavy workload and cannot dedicate the time necessary for the project. It is having an impact on the timeline. The home office model could be a lot further along if some of the required information was delivered as requested. Also, I am also getting a sense that there is a lack of ownership with regards to the Adaytum application. It is important that the users have a comfort level with the application otherwise it will become very difficult to transition it when the project is over. We need to think about who will administer the system once it is in full production. This individual should be identified and running the administration duties as soon as possible. My fear is that without proper ownership of the application and a dedicated administrator (at least in the short run), it will be very difficult to transition the roles. We've had some technical issues with the production and development environment. Although these issues have been resolved, it has had an impact on the timeline. There are times that the definition for the model is not clearly articulated and it has resulted in the redesign of the model. Much time has been spent on gathering business process information from various people which has caused a delay in the model development. I hope that we can constructively talk through these issues tomorrow and produce solutions that will rectify the situation, mitigate the risks, and result in a successful implementation. Our call is scheduled for 1:30 tomorrow but I can be available earlier if you would like to discuss this.

As far as the problem with only one user being able to get in NYMEX ACCESS at a time. I have a call into the NYMEX about this. We get a terminal per seat, so since we have two seats, we get two terminals at no cost. The 3 additional terminals have to be leased from other NYMEX members and the NYMEX is arranging the initial lease for us and will pay the lease, cost free for the first 6 months. After 6 months any cost associated with the 3 additonal terminals will have to be borne by ENA. I have a call into the NYMEX to find out what the status of our 3 leases is. 3.

Jim Sent: Tuesday, August 21, 2001 10:35 AM Importance: High As I discussed earlier with Rick, sasha Jacob is leaving GPC at the end of the month to join another firm. sash is particularly valuable becuase of his impeccable connections with Jim Wilson (the Minister of energy) and the staffers on the government side of the Legislature. What I wouldn't mind talking through with you is the continuing need for assistance re the media here, as Tom McLaren proposes. I think we need it and Peter Varley would be good to work with in that regard - he is the Premier's former Press Secretary and has conections with the major Toronto dilies that have proved helpful. Sent: Tuesday, August 21, 2001 9:34 AM Importance: High Aleck: Further to our phone call, as promised I am sending you this e-mail to confirm our interest in ensuring that Enron Canada can secure the consulting resources it requires at the current time to ensure an expeditious and assured opening of Ontario's electrical power market. As well, as you know we have superior resources in Alberta and elsewhere to augment your government relations, media and public affairs resources. I would like to meet with you today or early Wednesday to discuss an amended going-forward task assignment for GPC, given the likelihood of assigning the Queen's Park contact program to Sasha, or his new firm. I would ask that should you be successful in concluding an engagement agreement with Sasha or his firm that you inform us and I will have our in-house counsel confirm the removal of any restrictive covenants that Sasha has with GPC that would prevent him from doing consulting work with you. While the contact program you want Sasha to work on is key to your objectives, it is nonetheless only one element of a comprehensive campaign, so whatever your arrangements with Sasha or his firm may be, we see GPC's critical areas of support as follows. GPC would continue to provide strategic advice on the overall program to secure Enron Canada's market opening in Ontario, including advice to you on the Queen's Park Contact Program. Assuming that you will be working with Sasha to execute the Queen's Park contact program, we still believe that our assessment of the situation will be very valuable, particularly with the opposition parties and for giving you an independent back channel to gauge your success. GPC would also provide advice to you on the management of other important stakeholders, such the municipal utilities, major power consumers, consumer and environmental/social advocates and others who may slow down or derail the market reforms. Regarding the opposition parties, we endorse your strategy of maintaining the current support of the Official Opposition Liberals. GPC is well positioned to assist in this political arena. It should be separated from the government program in our view if possible. The media will also perform a pivotal role in shaping the public's understanding of the issue. In this respect, we would recommend that GPC's Peter Varley assist you. Our approach would be to ensure that the major media outlets in key government constituencies are targeted to have an accurate and favourable response to Enron Canada's position. Ideally, we would work to ensure that these outlets are proactively supportive of the market opening in their respective editorial positions and that Enron is a preferred media contact. This would enable you be in a better position to shape the media debate. To accomplish this we would recommend both a proactive and reactive approach - i.e., media plan, contact program, program delivery and day-to-day monitoring and rapid response (Aleck this is much like we did for project Stanley). GPC would also develop all collateral materials for all audiences including the media, government, regulators and market stakeholders. This would include briefing notes, Q&A, media releases, policy papers etc. Outside Ontario, there are other concerns, including some current issues underway in Alberta, which Enron Canada should be alerted to from time to time and GPC can help you understand those concerns as they arise and assess the value of strategic intervention. As we discussed, I will be the overall account manager for GPC and I strongly recommend that you, Sasha and I meet as a team twice a month to coordinate our efforts and to exchange intelligence. I have also reviewed our current contractual arrangement with you (our letter agreement from 08 June 2000) and I believe a new contract is not required as our current contract would seem to be appropriate. It sets out a comprehensive set of deliverables which covers all the points I have outlined above, and an agreed understanding between you and me on a budget will fit within the terms of that contract. Once again Aleck, thanks for your support and patience and, as you can tell, we value your business very highly. I will call you to set up a convenient time to meet to ensure this overview is consistent with our discussions and also to review with you the members of the GPC team.

Sent: Wednesday, October 10, 2001 8:28 AM We met with SoCal today to discuss the changes SoCal is making for November 1. Here is a high level recap in relation to impacts on TW: 1. SoCal will NOT set the capacity at needles lower than 750 unless they have operational problems. And they will maintain 750 for a gas day (during all cycles). (Good news for TW) 2. SoCal may set a capacity higher than 750. If they do, they will maintain that capacity for a gas day (during all cycles), unless there are specific operational problems. (Good news for TW) 4. SoCal will have the option to call OFO's at the beginning of each cycle for the gas day, which could cause a confirmation reduction. Today they only call an OFO before the gas day begins. Starting Nov. 1, they can call an OFO anytime before a GISB cycle, including Intraday 1 and Intraday 2 which are cycles in the gas day. (This will be a major impact to SoCal's customers) 5. SoCal says the ""windowing"" is gone. But, they are still giving us a capacity and TW will continue to do the allocation if nominations exceed their capacity. 6. SoCal can still reduce the scheduled volumes after an allocation. This would be due to SoCal's market not burning their schedule. At that time SoCal will confirm down to the market burn. Overall, our process does not change. If you have any questions, please let me know. Thanks. Lynn",Neutral,2001

The giving of written notice to WestLB may result in the equipment being subject to the notice coming on the balance sheet. If there is a subsequent problem in closing, the equipment is tainted. I believe Enron has coordinated this with WestLB, so that the notice period can be shortened until there is a certainty of closing. A&K has prepared the assignment and assumption agreements in the past, and I will go out on a limb and suggest that they conform their form for this transaction. We will have a couple of changes in the GE consent and assignment agreement, based on changes requested by WestLB in connection with the TurboPark transaction. I'll make the changes.

The creator's = goal is to give Californians more control over their energy and electric fu= tures as well as giving the tax/rate payers a share of the pie in return fo= r money that has/will go to the utilities. We will continue to monitor thi= s plan, its supporters and progress. Plan Z California State Treasurer Phil Angelides and a powerful group of legisla= tors are finally taking action and are developing a plan to solve Californi= a's energy crisis this summer. The group is comprised of leftish legislato= rs, environmental advocates, in-state energy company executives and busines= s leaders and they are pulling together a Plan Z. At the core of the plan = is the recently passed authorization to erect a California Public Power Aut= hority that issues bonds, constructs new power plants and buys up transmiss= ion lines. There is even talk within this group of using newly legislated = authority to buy SoCal Edison for $3.5 billion (less than it owes) although= they would face huge obstacles and receive strong opposition from power co= mpanies as well as Edison itself. The five-year goal is to have enough power generation capacity to guarant= ee a 5%-15% ""cushion"" against energy peak demand. Angelides and Burton wan= t to create enough capacity to form a buyer's market. One of the points of= the plan is to replace private sector generation with more public sector g= eneration. This plan may short-circuit private sector plans to build new p= lants, but the state has the ability to issue $5B in revenue-backed bonds (= in addition to the $12B rate-backed bonds). The second key element in th= e Angelides-Burton Plan Z is additional rate hikes for California's consume= rs and businesses. Although discussions are still underway between this gr= oup and business leaders, Angelides is wanting to propose an additional 45%= increase in residential and commercial electricity rates, however, there i= s immense sympathy for loading a disproportionate share of the burden on bu= sinesses. This increase is on top of the 50%-60% already mandated by prev= ious PUC decisions this year. These rate increases will do two things: sto= p the immediate fiscal drain on the state of California and prevent emergen= cy tax hikes (being serious considered last week). =20 Issues to consider in regards to this plan are: (1) how much will current= shareholders be diluted in return for helping the utilities repay long-owe= d debts (or what would they get if the state decided to buy up all of SoCal= Edison); and (2) how much will creditors have to ""eat"" in the legislated r= epayment plan? In other words how big will the equity and bond haircuts b= e? There is no answer to these questions right now as legislators work to = cobble together a plan with numbers that work without triggering a massive = and politically destructive rebellion by voters next year.",Neutral,2001

The current text suggests that there is significant strategic advantage for ENA to be a participant in the fund. I do not think that is the case; however, I do see some merits in the investment based on the needs of Enron's Global Finance group. I would suggest toning down the strategic advantages and add the following: It is unlikely that given the funds target returns that the it will be an effective permanent monetization vehicle for ENA's strategic and merchant investments; however, Enron Global Finance believes that the investment is important for the following reasons: a) provides an additional ""Friend of Enron"" to facilitate short to medium term balance sheet and regulatory solution to highly structured commodity and capital transactions in the wholesale group; b) provides alternative sources of short term capital liquidity and c) by further developing the relationship with AIG provides collateral benefits for Enron's overall Global Finance capability and business.

I regret his decision, but I accept and understand it. I have worked closely with Jeff for more than 15 years, including 11 here at Enron, and have had few, if any, professional relationships that I value more. I am pleased to say that he has agreed to enter into a consulting arrangement with the company to advise me and the Board of Directors. Now it's time to look forward. With Jeff leaving, the Board has asked me to resume the responsibilities of President and CEO in addition to my role as Chairman of the Board. I have agreed. I want to assure you that I have never felt better about the prospects for the company. All of you know that our stock price has suffered substantially over the last few months. One of my top priorities will be to restore a significant amount of the stock value we have lost as soon as possible. Our performance has never been stronger; our business model has never been more robust; our growth has never been more certain; and most importantly, we have never had a better nor deeper pool of talent throughout the company. We have the finest organization in American business today. Together, we will make Enron the world's leading company.

All they will do is reset prices. The Utilities and the CPUC will then have to decide the legality and the equity of modifying the PX Credit and hence the Negative CTC. We have tried in the CA Refund process to highlight the fact that much of the ""high"" prices were due to inappropriate policy and actions of the CPUC, Governor, and Utilities. The core problem with this line of argument is that the Refund process didn't ask the first question - what or who is to blame. It simply took dysfunction and ran. We are trying in the context of the Rehearing case to ask FERC to restart with the right question. Also, remember that we aren't going to have a solution in the FERC case until sometime next year, probably after SCE gets its money. Finally, I think that the right policy decision is not to ""re-bill"" Negative CTC but rather to prospectively recover the costs. On point #2 - See point above. I doubt, however, that all ""high"" prices can be seen as just a result of underscheduling. Jim Sent: Wednesday, October 10, 2001 10:32 AM Two questions: 1. How do we fight the notion that a FERC retroactive determination of ""just and reasonable rates"" should be re-injected into the calculation of negative CTCs? It seems to me that there are at least equitable arguments against that. Will this be a CPUC or FERC issue? 2. Can we use the utilities' underscheduling to push them back on this, legally or in negotiations?

EDG HPL's intent for initiating EOL service: Sell interruptible transport in stated volume increments Develop daily, weekly and monthly markets in transport that parallel the Texas desk business (price the transportation service required to supply a peaking deal or a week day only deal.) Proposed EOL language by Steve Hotte with Northern's IT group. He is the lead on this project from an EOL perspective A transaction under which the specified Enron natural gas pipeline will transport, on an interruptible basis, a maximum daily volume (stated in MMBtu per day) equal to the volume identified on the website. The gas will be transported from the specified receipt point(s) to the specified delivery point(s). The bid and offer rates are stated as one-part rates in $(US) per MMBtu. If a transaction is consummated, the shipper will be billed the one-part rate, which is inclusive of all applicable surcharges, based on usage. In addition, the shipper will be billed the applicable charge for fuel. The term of the transaction will correspond to the dates shown on the website. Additional considerations for HPL's participation, EOL language and GTC (?) language. HPL needs a two part rate, the first part to be billed regardless of use (a demand charge). Colleen suggested a very small charge ($.0025/MMBtu) to keep counterparties from buying capacity and leaving us high and dry. The second part is the total rate less the demand charge that will be billed on a commodity basis. The rate billed will never be larger than the rate transacted on EOL. HPL will not have a bid at this time. Theoretically, HPL owns all the interruptible transportation capacity and it would be purchasing capcity from itself. In short, HPL will not be showing bids. Points will really be market zones with well defined pipeline points within them. Bouncing between points (as capacity at each point allows) will be permitted as long as the shipper continues to utilize the path purchased. The transaction is good for the time purchased, if there is a break in the shipper's use during the transaction, the capcity must be renegotiated, in any event the demand charge will be billed for the full term of the transaction.",Neutral,2000

The pipeline admitted that EES has been using their transport contracts and have been paying their bills since the bankruptcy petition date. The $2.1 million claim that TCO had been including in the Enron ""set off amount"" (i.e. the remaining demand charges for EES's agreements until the end of the contract terms) was pulled out TCO's Motion. The minimum OBA/pooling agreement monthly balance should no longer be required by the pipeline (Note: Originally TCO appeared to be using EES's minimum balance to set off ENA & EES obligations).

Re: Draft Nordic Power Master Agreement,mark.taylor@enron.com,martin.rosell@enron.com,"Thu, 24 Jun 1999 04:36:00 -0700 (PDT)",<13281401.1075860055962.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Elizabeth Sager, who is responsible for power trading documentation in North America and was in large part responsible for drafting the Industrial Master several years ago, is reviewing the proposed form. She will have comments for us by Monday morning, Houston time. Martin Rosell 06/22/99 09:04 AM cc: Edmund Scott Justin Mark Mark - ECT Legal Thor Please find attached a copy of the above document, marked to show changes from the draft of S&M, together with a clean copy thereof (please disregard any layout or file format deficiencies). Besides further streamlining and refining of the doc, I've also styled it somewhat differently why it, on the face of the mark-ups, may appear even more amended than is the case. I've chosen to call the doc. 'Nordic Power Master Agreement' and inserted the Norwegian name of the Nordic Power Traders Association (""NPTA"") in the header (hopefully, NPTA will be prepared to launch and market the doc. in its own name). I've also prepared a brief Schedule addressing the optionality offered by the document. The document is originally based upon ECT's Industrial Master Agreement. In the Industrial Agreement, terms such as ""the Contract"", ""this Contract"", ""this Agreement"" and ""the Agreement"" are used interchangeably and not always with great preciseness. In the attached document the terms ""this Master Agreement"" or ""this Agreement"" are used consistently (the latter to include all Transactions). These are my remarks to the (principal) changes made, and to some issues that the new doc gives rise to: 1. Transactions. I've introduced some ISDA wordings herein (for example, the ""Inconsistency"" provisions) and deleted text that I find less appropriate or necessary in the current context. 2. Obligations This is a critical Section since it also refers to products for which there currently are no NPTA documentation (""Options"" and ""Collars""). When I discussed this with the Nordic trading desk it sounded less thrilled about us expanding the current Nordic bilateral power contracts range, and I have therefore left references to options (other than swaptions and Asian options) within square brackets (including related definitions). (Supposedly, this will be something for the Working Group, Reference Group and the NPTA to determine.) I've expanded the text on SWAPs and included a brief reference to ASIAN (options) and also streamlined the Tax clause. 3. Representation Reps are not particularly common in Nordic law contracts. The ""No Reliance"" reps appear to be typically American and may not be to everyone's taste. Since parties seldom are prepared to give ""Payee"" reps I've cut out that part and also taken out the ""Payer"" reps as something that we should be able to do without. I also feel a bit hesitant towards S&M's proposed ""Changes in Representation"" and therefore rubbed that one out as well (whilst being at it). 4. Market Disruption Since the underlying reference price (Nord Pool's spot price) is quoted on an hourly basis, some wordings have been included to reflect that. 5. Events of Default I'm mostly concerned about the cross-default clause. Insofar as ECTRIC (and its possible Credit Support Provider) is concerned, we may, in this particular context, lose more than we gain from a cross default provision. Also, the cross default also only appears to apply to ""borrowed money"" (and ""such obligation"") and not default under any other ""specified transactions"". It's worth considering making cross default optional and part of the Schedule instead. 6. Remedies As the enforceability of close-out netting in certain jurisdictions may require the automatic termination of all Transactions, it's necessary to offer the parties the choice of ""Automatic Early Termination"" in the Schedule. 7. Events of Change I've followed the route of the Nordic 'Amendment Agreement' and pulled together ""Events of Change"" and ""Change in Tax Law"" and done my best to streamline this sections since it undoubtedly will raise questions from local players in due course. (The former sections 8 (Credit Support), 9 (Set-off) and 10 (Confidentiality) have been edited out. The former because of the streamlining of the credit provisions (and related definitions) and the two latter since those concern issues that rather should be addressed by the parties bilaterally.) 8. Governing Law and Jurisdiction As previously discussed, this part is something for the parties to agree upon in the Schedule. 9. Documents As above under 8. 10. Miscellaneous I've crossed out the former ""Currency Provisions"" since it won't be enforceable in certain jurisdictions. (Might be something for the Schedule.) 11. Definitions Some of the credit terms have been stricken out. With reference to my earlier comment with respect to the uncertainty relating to the inclusion into the document of further options instruments, the related terms defined are in between square brackets. Some of the defined terms may need to be further refined to better reflect the products, trading routines and settlement mechanisms in the Nordic Electricity market. Exhibit A The relevant details can be found in the Schedule. ---------------------------------------------------- Please return with any comments you may have before close of business on Thursday (Oslo time).

Currently URM is responsible for virtually every curve and thus knows very little about a whole lot. The proposed reduction would help URM focus on what is important and allow them to ""get it right"". I do not think it is necessary nor is it appropriate to offer bundled products until we can determine effective ways to reduce our existing exposure. I do think we can stand ready to adjust this strategy if necessary and on a case by case basis. I do think we can offer shaped, staggered maturity wholesale products to generally hedge customers in regulated states against directional price movements. I am absolutely against offering anything that looks like the traditional Retail Index Product. I expect to get a little push back on this approach and also think I will hear that it is necessary to offer bundled products to support DSM.

Overall, I felt we made a lot of progress. At the end of the call, Pirog said that prior to the call he was uncertain whether a deal was possible, but at the end he said that he thought we could probably work through a number of the issues and he said he was going to send some sample language for our consideration on a few of the points. We said that we would be begin to modify our draft as well to reflect some of the concepts we spoke about and that we could then ""compare notes."" He said that CDWR viewed the Enron Contract as an important one and he said he would be back to us fairly quickly. Material Regulatory Change Provision. Pirog said CDWR would be willing to accept such a provision if it were limited to an event that adversely affects CDWR's ability to perform under the contract, most particularly its ability to pay for power. (Such an event likely would be a CA legislature or regulatory generated change). Pirog said he thought that CDWR would agree to a termination payment if this occurred, although they may not want the MRC to be characterized as a ""default"" (which should not be a problem from our standpoint). CDWR would not be willing to protect EPMI for a change (e.g., in law) that materially affects EPMI's business, but does not adversely affect CDWR's ability to make payments to EPMI. (For example, a new CA law that requires sellers into CA to turn over all their books and records to the CPUC). Further, as we anticipated, he said CDWR was not willing to be on the hook for a termination payment for an event outside its control, such as a FERC change or Federal Legislation that adversely affects us. However, he did say that CDWR might entertain a ""no LD walk right"" for EPMI if such a change adversely affected it. My sense is that ultimately Pirog/CDWR will back track on that since such a change could occur when our contract is heavily in the money to CDWR and this would allow us an out without paying LDs. Early Walk Provision. He reiterated that CDWR would not extend the Option. With respect to the early walk away right that has been offered, it was discussed that this could be structured in such a way that EPMI could walk from the deal (without receiving or paying a Termination Payment) up until a date certain (September 1 and September 30 were mentioned by me as possibilities, although Pirog said that other suppliers had a shorter window) (our request is based on the gloomy news that has been eminating from the CA Treasurer's office about the bond issue), provided that if the bonds were issued earlier than that, the walk away right would terminate; that is, EPMI would not be free to walk if CDWR was able to issue bonds with an investment grade rating prior to the Drop Dead Date. Termination Payment Due Date. Pirog said CDWR cannot shorten it from 180 days. He said all other suppliers have lived with that. Pirog is sympathetic to our concerns, but said that the ""bond guys"" are already nervous about only having 180 days (if they had to issue bonds to pay the LDs). Suspension of Delivery. Emphasizing our concern with the 180 days, I requested that CDWR provide some flexibility on our right to suspend perfromance in the event of an event of default and, perhaps some other events, such as a bond downgrade. Pirog said he thought CDWR could work with us on that. Downgrade not a Default. CDWR was not willing to have a bond downgrade an event of default. However, he said CDWR would be willing to consider having a Downgrade Event a ""no LD walk right"" for EPMI and perhaps an event justifying EPMI in suspending deliveries. In other words, a Downgrade Event would be treated like an Event of Default, but no termination payment would be owed and EPMI would have the flexibility to suspend performance. Pirog also discussed adding a covenant that CDWR would attempt to secure a Credit Rating with respect to the claims paying ability of the Fund in the event that no bonds were issued. That is, if no Bonds were outstanding and the Fund did not have an investment grade rating, we could terminate, but without LDs. Cross Defaults. This clearly is one of CDWR's hot buttons, and we will not be able to get this is my sense. However, when asked about the idea of a Cross Default Out w/out a termination payment, he stated that he would like to discuss that further with CDWR. LD Calculation Methodology. Pirog said it was very unlikely CDWR would accept our proposed language. He said they are striving for consistency among contracts and said their proposal is viewed as more ""objective."" My sense is that we will need to get comfortable with it in general. Arbitration. In general, Pirog did not have a problem, except for the following: a desire to limit it to contractual claims only (i.e., no tort actions, extra-contractual disputes, etc. would be subject to it). Also, holding hearings in New York City was not well received, and a request was made that all three arbitrators be neutral. I would think that the situs issue will be a big one for Richard Sanders in light of the political environment if a dispute were to arise. My general sense, however, is that this is not a ""deal breaker"" for CDWR. Assignment. In general, he understood the nature of our changes on this issue and said they were reasonable although he caveated that on this issue as well they are looking for some consistency. We were again asked if assignment back to the IOUs would be acceptable, even though he knew what our reaction would be. Pirog offered to provide us sample language, which we said we would look at. We stated that conceptually this would be a difficult sell in light of the environment. He did not elaborate on how stringent the assignment standards are in the other deals. New Govt Charge Pass Throughs. A pass through of some governmental charges was considered to be okay, but he said our proposed language was too broad. Pirog offered to provide some examples of acceptable language on this. He di agre, howeve, that if for example, CA imposed an excess profits tax, that it was fair for us to be protected from that. Legal Opinions. Pirog did not think that a legal opinion from Hawkins would be forthcoming, although he did say that he would look into whether or not they would be providing one on the bonds. Also, he said it was a possibility that the California Attorney General would issue the opinion on the bonds, so we might possibly ask for that in lieu of an opinion from Hawkins. Realistically, it likely will be very difficult to get this before we have to extend the option; perhaps, we can put in a covenant on CDWR to get us that before our walk right expires. Additional CDWR Covenants. Pirog stated that the additional covenants we have requested are conceptually okay with him, but need to be discussed internally with CDWR. Pro Rata ""Spread"" Amortization. Pirog had not reviewed the idea of amortizing the Credit Amount over the four year term, and said that he would run it by CDWR. CDWR Information. Pirog said he would follow up with CDWR on how often it plans to give suppliers financial information. He was resisting our request for monthly information, although I pointed out that we really only wanted information that frequently in the beginning of the transaction as things start to fall into place.

Sara David 02/02/2000 03:39 PM cc: Alan Master Swap Agreement Sara, US legal opinions on guaranties is a hot issue for us. We needed to get one when we were first granted our licence to trade electricity derivatives in 1998 from Cadwalader Wickersham and Taft. It advises on the enforcability of a guaranty under NY law in NY. I will fax it to you. I was planning on getting an updated opinion as our guaranty form has developed. Also there are several counterparties who are insisting on an individual opinion, which to date we have not been willing give. I am also working through Clement Abrams to get a legal opinion From Vincent and Elkins on the enforceability of judgment in Australian court in respect of a Guaranty in NY. That is a more complicated exercise. Anyway to answer your question it is customary to an extent. A number of law firms advise their clients to get to cover themselves. Who is the counterparty?

If the Legislature does get the budget done and recesses without addressing the energy issues, then decision-making on some key issues---Direct Access in particular---will fall back in the PUC's lap. (The Legislature is scheduled to be out until August 20th.) The PUC has scheduled a vote on whether to suspend DA, the rate agreement with DWR, DWR's rev. req. and other issues on August 23rd. PUC President Loretta Lynch has said that she wants to issue a proposed decision on these issues sometime between now and the first week of August. As Jim points out, we continue to try to hammer out favorable outcomes for Direct Access and cost allocation in both forums----the Legislature and the PUC.

Looks like the only thing that is going to happen will be a Budget without anything on energy restructuring (could continue to change). There will be some additional negotiating on SBX2 78 over the recess. Enron is looking for a way into those discussions (Jeff Dasovich). We will try to push good language on DA dates and assignment of Utility and CDWR costs. On another note, CDWR has announced its revenue requirements going forward. The numbers are significantly less than had previously been expected (due to lower costs for spot market purchases). The end result, if their figures are correct, is that the March 27 3c/kwh increase would be sufficient going forward (we are trying to validate). The key is that now the Retained Generation proceedings will determine if any more $ is needed from retail customers.

This largely represents TURN's proposal. The Senate also passed a budget and has since adjourned until August 20. The Assembly had been considering two MOUs, ABX 82 (Keeley) and ABX 50 (Wright). Both bills had difficulty attracting a majority of votes given their different approaches to dealing with SCE. ABX 82 for example, had large users picking up most of the tab for SCE's undercollection whereas ABX 50 split those charges among all users. Both bills provided for some type of direct access and ABX 82 also provided for a purchase of the transmission system. In light of the difficulty in passing either bill, it appears as if the Assembly will shelve both proposals today in order to amend SBX 78 over the summer break. An internal legislative working group may be formed to draft amendments but this has not been confirmed. Large users have begun drafting extensive amendments recognizing that in its current form SBX 78 has very little to offer. The Assembly will try to pass the final portion of the budget today and recess until August 20.",Neutral,2001

Wow, I'm back, its hard to believe. Sitting at my desk trying to get used to being here in the office and having people shout hey Mrs. Ruppert is kind of freaky too. I'm ready for my afternoon siesta which I've become accustomed to in the last couple weeks. Well I must say the honeymoon was amazing! Everything I could have wanted and just what we needed. We truly had a wonderful time. The trip there was quite exhausting especially after the wedding and all. we got settled into Athens around 4 p.m. Monday. Our hotel had a balcony which had a wonderful view of the Acropolis. Athens is pretty dirty and the Greeks there are kind of assholes, but I really didn't think it was as bad as people kept telling me, I mean its a big city. We did our own walking tour of all the ruins (I try to avoid large groups of formal tours). We took a ferry to Santorini and stayed there for 3 days. Loved it! We ate some faboulous restaurants on cliffs overlooking the water. Lots of shrimp, squid, lamb, vegetables, bread and of course my favorite THE WINE! We rented a car one day and drove all over the entire island stopping periodically at various beaches to absorb the rays. Unfortunately we hadn't anticipated laying out so we didn't bring swimsuits. As being the sport I am I wanted to be apart of the culture so I took the rays in in just my briefs. Ryan surprisingly left his shorts on this time??? Loved the black beaches! We tried to find a more private beach to partake in some skinny dipping, but were busted at our attempt. We went to an area called Oia on Santorini, which was amazing. We drove down the mountain and at the bottom there was this bay area enclosed in rock with a few tavernas. so we had dinner there and watched the sunset. The most amazing seafood! They took us in their kitchen to show us what they had caught that day. We also took a boat out to the volcano at Ryan's request being a geologist and all. We hiked 2 1/2 miles all uphill and then of course back down. We went to the hot springs which Ryan said wasn't so hot, I did not venture in the water. After the ride we had to get all the way back to the top so we took donkeys of course. Quite an adventure as we were weaving around these narrow paths on the edge of the cliff! Luckily mine was tame, Ryan's however was a jackass(mmm, appropriate I thought). We also took a ferry to Ios, which unfortunately it rained the whole day so we stayed inside, slept and later went to some bars and met some great people which we later went out with that night. You all should have seen Ryan at the discos! Our final destination was Naxos about a 2 1/2 ferry ride from Santorini. Ate, shopped, toured the island, slept on the beach, drank, ate again and slept. Loved this island a lot. Not as touristy and the greeks were very pleasant and charming. Would have loved to stay there longer. All in all the wedding was fabulous. I was very happy with the wedding festivities too. And of course as everyone had said it went by sooo fast. The next morning Ryan and I were so confused about what had taken place the night before. I cannot believe I am a married woman, its all so surreal! The few days prior to the wedding I was so nervous and emotional about everything! Its just so overwhelming. One of the best parts was sitting on the alter in the cathedral and looking out upon our friends and family and people's faces lighting up. Knowing that all those people were there to share in our special moment was just so wonderful. Of course I wish I could have spent more time chatting with each and everyone one of you. We were so honored you all traveled so far for us! I am definitely on cloud 9 now and would have to say I feel the happiest I've ever been! Thanks again for joining us it truly meant a lot. I hope you all had a wonderful time and enjoyed yourselves. Everyone was surprisingly on their best behavior...frankly I was a little disappointed in you gals! Except for Falb she always pulls through with something! Anyway, love to hear from you all soon. Hope everyone is well! Forever Gams! Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at",Positive,2001

This year it is in a leading Barcelona restaurant preceded by a bus tour of the city with a stop for pre-dinner drinks. I would like to invite you to make the opening keynote address, the highlight of the conference. The subject could be: a general energy risk related topic a general insight into the secret of Enron's continued success in the energy markets your thoughts on the future development on energy markets (and other commodity related - bandwidth etc.) worldwide Obviously, we would cover all your delagate costs including accomodation, food and drink.

Sent: Tuesday, November 06, 2001 10:37 AM CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY/CLIENT PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATION On the VEPCO contract we also need to consider the damages for failure to deliver scheduled energy. Yesterday we talked about normal LDs. This likely will not work if we are basing the VEPCO price on an hourly index since VEPCO's cost of cover would likely be close to hourly prices. Under the current contract, if we fail to deliver, EPMI is obligated to pay: 1. Cost of Cover defined as either (a) (1) actual cost of incremental purchase or generation costs or if VEPCO is unable to make up the delivery obligations, then (2) VEPCO's highest cost source of generation minus (b) offered energy price (hourly index price under new proposal) Section 9.2); plus either (A) If VEPCO has designated day as a Peak Day (up to 30 per year), then rebate a portion of annual capacity payments (I think current amount would be about $530,000 per non-delivery if no MW delivered during day) (Section 9.3); or (B) If VEPCO has not designated day as a Peak Day (up to 30 per year), then rebate a portion of daily capacity payments (I think current amount would be about $42,000 per non-delivery if no MW delivered during day) Section 9.5); Let's think about what we should propose (eg 150% of index hourly price per hour of non-delivery?)

ENE will retain the option to deliver the physical energy at any point identified in the contract. The legal definition of the settlement index has been reviewed by Paul Thomas in Kevin's group, and will be as follows: The Floating Price during a Determination Period shall be the average of the hourly prices listed in the Index for electricity delivered at the during the applicable hours on each Delivery Day during the applicable Determination Period.

Sent: Thursday, September 27, 2001 3:31 PM Yes, we're getting paid--our payment for August gas came in under CSN. Why we're still able to supply them given the contract is terminated is my question. Wes Dempsey made it sound like a contract was being considered/negotiated and that we were in fact supplying them in the interim. CSN is upset that we are issuing bills to Heartland Steel, however, I am constrained to doing just that since there is no contract or counterparty in existence. Obviously we will continue in this manner until there's a counterparty and contract established. The only information I received from my contact at Heartland Steel, Carrie Allen, who is now at CSN is a number and name for the attorneys handling their bankruptcy. They are Alvarez & Marsal @ 212-759-4433 and she gave me the name TJ Schultz. I hope this information helps somewhat. Please let me know how to handle this customer...

Sent: Thursday, September 27, 2001 2:49 PM Hey Guys, I do not feel that the Heartland Steel/CSN issue is resolved. We are now getting calls from a representative of CSN (Companhia Sidergica Nacional, LLC) saying that they have purchased Heartland Steel effective July, 2001. If this is the case, then why are we continuing to invoice Heartland Steel? Have we been paid by Heartland Steel? Have we been continuing to receive the prepayments, and if so from whom? Has CSN assumed the contractual obligations of Heartland Steel? While the credit risk is not my responsibility, I am, however, extremely concerned that we really do not have a firm handle on the identity of our actual counterparty. Will you please let me know how we should proceed. I have a call into the CSN representative and it appears that they are not really happy with us, and would like to receive a visit from an Enron representative. Let me know what the game plan is by noon, Friday, September 28, 2001. Thank you for your cooperation.",Negative,2001

They exercised and sold, exercised and sold. And told all the employees to hold. While they made billions, they continued to say Our company will be the greatest someday. But lo and behold it would not come to pass. It was all a fraud and scam most would call crass. ""How could it be true?"" we all asked. ""All we do is buy and sell gas"". But to make their personal billions They had to keep in the dark their minions. So they lied and cheated, stole and cajoled Analysts, investors, workers and sold and sold. But they found out the scam And put the company in quite a stew. They told Ken and Andy ""we have lost confidence"". Little did they know, that confidence is what cons do. The old man in charge said ""we all trust Andy, he's fine, He made me my fortune and never charged a dime!"" Andy got paid to manage illegal partnerships you see, And for that he collected thirty m! illion as his fee. But the pressure was on, and Ken had to act. He told Andy, ""You must go on leave"" Is he still on the payroll we asked? We get no answer. Seems Andy will be there to the last. Ken restated his books, and oh the looks that Were on the faces of all but the crooks. The books had been cooked! Not one year, not two, not even three, They had been cooked a total of four. And many suspect even more!.. He went into the elevator, that old gas trader. He hit floor fifty, where his offices reside. With two armed guards standing at his side. And so he rose to the top of 1400 Smith And went into the boardroom forthwith. There were the ghosts of Fastow, and Skilling. Where with their cronies they devised great scams. How to deceive, cheat, and steal millions of clams. And with one more scam to do He picked up the phone and called his friend Chuck. ""Chuck"", he said, "" I'm in quite a jam, can! you please help me I got caught in my scam"". So old Chuck bit a nd came to Kens side, First with some money and took Ken as his bride. But that old scoundrel had played too many scams This one he could not hide as Chucks lawyers and guides Went over Ken's books and found such a surprise. There were no trades, there were no counterparties. There were no assets, there was no Christmas party. And so Chuck went to Ken and said ""Your company Is a sham. It was all lies. I cannot merge with you. Your firm is a rotting carcass festering with flies! And so Ken thought. He thought and he thought. He will file Chapter eleven and fire a lot. Four thousand to be exact. We thought he has lost gazillions, but prior filing he managed to bonus his friends fifty eight Million. And so we are told, the company will be back. A shell of itself but not quite the same.

These need to have daily swaps on them in sitara as opposed to monthly swaps. This will insure that the physical deal comes to the physical trader at gas daily as opposed to mid. This is very important to avoid OA variances. 3. When booking deals in sitara, please look at your swaps when they are created to verify that they are coming at the right mid/gd price. This is important because we have so many deals that are booked to new mids and I notice last night on a gd option, that the swap did not come at the correct gd curve. 4. I am going to set up a mtg. for friday or monday to discuss OA, the process and how to prepare forms. 5. Please take advantage of time that you can spend with your traders.

Please read the attached and confirm that this is your understanding of the PGET/EPMI/ EEMC assignment. I am also at this time forwarding to the working group my four main points, which I think reflect my main areas of concern under the drafts: 1. I would like to say that the price is the same under the transactions. Transaction costs should be dealt with separately. 2. While we have agreed to take a pass through of the bankruptcy risk, this draft provides that we take on all contract dispute risk. As I understand it, EPMI intends to pass through all risk, such as change in delivery point risk, under the contract. Since EPMI is our sole provider of power to EES (other than the PGET contract), EPMI is in the best position to manage general contract risk with its counterparties, as it does today with all our physical electricity purchases. EPMI may have disputes under contracts for many reasons that EEMC is not aware of and will not be in a position to influence once the contracts are assigned to Avista. 3. I assume if EPMI trades out of these positions as it manages its own portfolio, the credit risk would not follow to subsequent counterparties and the EPMI/EES confirm terms would revert to typical confirm language. 4. I was operating under the assumption that the tax issue would be resolved with Steve Douglass prior to signing the main documents. I am not sure whether this issue can be quantified by EES tax today. Any suggestions or ability to resolve/quantify today? Same concern for the accounting issues. My concern here is that if the transaction leaves us in a worse economic position as a result of making EPMI whole, this would need to be addressed with our business people.

Here are some items to consider, 1. Park balance on deal #1222 188,949 dth ( + or - 10,000 dth) 2. Loan balance on deal #1424 (96,000) dth 3. ENA sold Sonat 496,000 dth at $2.885 for Jan 2002 and did not deliver 418,708 dth (+ or - 10,000 dth, related to Item #1) 4. ENA sold Sonat 310,000 dth at $2.955 for May 2002, I don't know if this deal has been terminated or not. Rita, Maria and I are looking for the Sonat pipeline statements for Jan 2002. We have Dec 2001. Would you see if you have those and let one of us know please? Sonat may have stopped sending us statements, but this would answer my volume questions on items 1 and 3. Margaret, could you see if Sonat paid us for 77,292 dth x $2.885 = $222,987.42 for the sale in Jan 2002? I would be very surprised if they did. Sent: Thursday, March 14, 2002 10:32 AM 3/14/02 10:25 am Barbara Gilbert, my scheduling rep. at Sonat, informed me that the attorneys in Sonat's Houston office will be contacting Enron's attorneys to set up a meeting to address the PAL issue. . Christina Sanchez Sent: Thursday, March 14, 2002 10:08 AM 3/14/02 9:50 AM Per Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent. Tammi spoke to Lisa Guthrie (205-325-3816) at Sonat to find out what flexibility Sequent would have taking out the parked gas. Lisa said she didn't know if Enron could sell the gas. Sent: Wednesday, March 13, 2002 7:29 PM Thanks for the information. Sell, Sell, Sell! Sell it all to Sequent for March if you can get a good bid and have them agree to pay the moment we/they get confirmation on the nomination. Try to get other bids to validate as best you can. Do not talk to Sonat unless you have to - - asking permission is not advisable. Sent: Wednesday, March 13, 2002 4:38 PM Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat. This is what we have found out over the last 2 days. ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations. The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract. Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it. I need to know; 1. What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424. 2. What period do I sell the gas for? All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline? Or base load in April? I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok? 3. How many bids do I need to get? I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat. 4. This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below). Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas. I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it. All of my previous notes are shown below in blue. Summary: Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001. According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay. Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. 2/19/02 History - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat. All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001. Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract. Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back. ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth. The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002, SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system. Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002. Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth. In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th. That left a balance of 188,949 dth. On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001. According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424]. According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets. According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account. ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August. Other items; ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001. ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42. According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy. ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087). ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park. ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January. Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696). I left a message for Patti to call me. 2/20/02 Patti Frances returned my call. Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) that ENA did supply. Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay. I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed. She will check on it and call me back. 2/25/02 Per Kay Mann - Mark Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract. 1:10 PM. Left a follow-up message for Patti Frances regarding our conversation on 2/20/02. 3/11/02 Per Ruth - Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal. Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have access to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's. 3/13/02 Per Christina - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled. Christina called Barbara Gilbert (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - Barbara said she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID. Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations. The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream. 3:30 PM Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it. She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination. I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out. 3:40 PM Barbara is waiting to hear from Sonat's legal department.",Neutral,2002

McCUTCHEN, DOYLE, BROWN & ENERSEN, LLP Attached for your comments is a revised complaint in inverse condemnation, with the PX and Reliant as plaintiffs.? I am sending it separately to Susan Rossi, in-house counsel for the PX.? Since our last conference call we've discussed the various forums and pending actions with FERC counsel for Reliant and Enron. My understanding is that the PX wants us to act and will cooperate with us.? Marc, I haven't circulated this to the whole group because I wanted to go through you.? What is the appropriate next step?? A call with the decisionmakers on this issue so that we can make a plan to move forward?? Can we do that Monday or Tuesday? I've set out Reliant's conclusions here.? 1. There is no forum other than California state court in which we can get compensation for the commandeered contracts because of the Eleventh Amendment issue. 2. Filing the inverse condemnation action is not inconsistent with the FERC proceeding in Tucson Electric. 3. Filing the inverse condemnation action is not inconsistent with Duke v. Davis or with any other proceeding anyone may want to bring alleging that the commandeering itself was illegal (e.g. on preemption grounds). 4.? As we discussed, nobody (including PG&E and SCE) wants the Board of Control to be deciding anything if we can avoid it.? We would suggest going along with the PX's suggestion that the bankruptcy court should be staying the Board of Control action because of the interventions of SCE and PG&E, who are taking the position that the compensation should go to them.? Then, we can go forward with the inverse condemnation action in state court (we picked LA as the forum because LA residents are less affected by the energy crisis than most others in the state, and because it's convenient). If PG&E and SCE are permitted to intervene in the state court action, we can stipulate to relief from stay so that it can go forward.? This way, the Board of Control is effectively stayed while the state court action goes forward. 5.? Richard Sanders expressed the very real concern that we don't want SCE and PG&E's defenses to liquidation of the block forward contracts to be decided anywhere but FERC.? We think we should be able to avoid that: since SCE and PG&E have already put the issue squarely before FERC, that defense could be stayed under the primary jurisdiction doctrine pending FERC's decision.? We would argue that the whole case need not be stayed in the meantime, since the governor's duty to compensate holds no matter who is owed the compensation, and any proceeds from PX contracts will be funneled into the Moreno escrow account. 6.? As we also discussed, we can file this complaint in the name of the PX, Reliant, and any other market participants who want to be plaintiffs (we just need names and a few facts to allege for each plaintiff). Or, as someone suggested, if the PX Market Participants Committee is an entity that has standing, it could be filed in that name along with the PX.? Either way, the prayer for relief asks that all funds be deposited in the Moreno escrow account for disposition consistent with FERC's decision in Coral Power. ? - 213155872.DOC",Neutral,2001

I've been out and all over the world. I appreciate your help on this article. Attached is a copy of a presentation that will fill you in on some of the businesses that we are working on. This should give you some ideas and clarifications on the first draft. Here are a few other points of emphasis. EGM was created to provide sharpened focus on very large global markets and commodities to enable them to grow quickly These markets are huge and we will become a big player rather than being active in them EGM provideds true network for market making opportunities related to commodities that are highly liquid in physical and financial terms and are enormous in market size EGM leverages the value of Enron's existing network and international asset positions EGM's operation will coordinate with leveraging all of our wholesale businesses EGM has very aggressive growth targets in transactions and earnings EGM has contributed almost $200 million in gross margin in its first 2 quarters in existence Go big or go home philosophy EGM will represent a clear transfer of Enron wholesale market making model into other commodities this year GROWTH is the key!!!

Mark Frevert has requested that the Executive Letter be rotated among the presidents of EWS. This is the inside cover message and should be 300+ words. I hope that you will be able to squeeze this into your busy schedule. Here is a suggested outline. If you want to fill in the outline with information, I will be happy to turn it into a letter for you. I. An overview of EWS/EGM as we move forward. II. A short-term retrospective about EGM activities and successes III. Future plans/initiatives for EGM (strategic vision of the group, opportunities, expectations, etc.) Please feel free to modify as you see fit.

I'm hearing confusing messages about the way that the UK IT team and the UK traders get their Valuation code aparently signed off by Research, while here... You provide it for our guys to wrap up.

Please help with the following information: Enron project information (Parquet/McCubbin) -- please give me any presentations or summaries you have on the generation, or firm purchases, we have under way (or planned). I'll talk with you to find out what we are comfortable disclosing but please err on the side of giving whatever information you have. Updated Belden presentation (Hain/Belden) -- I believe the latest information was as of August; I think some of the information on the cost of peaking facilities is particularly eye-opening on the price cap issue. Comparison to PJM (Hartsoe/Novosel) -- Is the information we are seeking from the ISO and PX similar to information PJM already provides? If so, it would be nice to tie our requests back to something the Commission has already approved. Cancelled DSM projects (Mahoney) -- Again, I'll only use what we feel comfortable with, but it would help make our point if we can give examples of how price caps backfire when it comes to encouraging conservation. ISO/PX reports (Dasovich). I have the ISO market surveillance report. Is there another ISO report? If so, please get me a copy and provide a copy of the PX report too. CEC/Proposed generation update (Mara/Parquet) -- Need the basic information: proposed, waiting for permitting; how much/little the legislation did to expedite siting (ie are we still comfortable saying that it applies to less than 10%)? Soft cap(Belden/Hain) -- need a crisp explanation of why the ""soft"" nature of the cap is not sufficient. Also, would we be OK if the Commission revised it to say that bids can be taken above 150 without special filing or reporting requirements, but those bids will be accepted at the price bid rather than applying to all lower bids as well (ie the highest bid at or below 150 clears the market, bids above 150 accepted at price bid as needed)? Offers we have made/deals done (Parquet/Dasovich/ Mccubbin) -- Roseville plus any others, offer made to SDG&E -- I want to make the point that the market will provide solutions (below the retail price cap) if we get the utility (and the regulators) out of the merchant function. Herding the cats(Hartsoe/mccubbin/mara/dasovich): We are asking FERC to be courageous, do the right thing and ignore the politics. To be even halfway credible, we can't have IEP, EPSA, Dynegy or anyone else ""squishing"" on the price cap issue.. We have never been closer to reform in California, we need these guys on board.

The question is: How is MDQ used in the nomination system to ensure we do not double up on MDQ volumes when we have split paths (i.e. nom on same contract from (1) Mid 15 to Bushton Inlet and from (2) Bushton Outlet to Demac) For Nominating purposes: MDQ of contract = Primary Firm + Alternate Firm up to the MDQ. Anything over the MDQ will be Overrun and charged at the IT rate. Point MDQ needs to be considered when allocating a receipt point. EXAMPLE: If the Field MDQ is 10,000, then we will (1) total the reciepts nominated on the contract; (2) compare the total nominated to the Contract MDQ. Then the shipper will get firm (primary and alternate) up to their contract MDQ. Anything over will be overrun at IT rate. If anyone has any other questions, please let me know. Thanks.

He obviously has an interesting background that includes systems development, management and a strong technical training. Ideally, he could fit somewhere between research and systems development. Somewhat of a unique combination. He also has a background in derivatives and other financial instruments. In short, he could be very interesting for us in supporting Asian activities, but also if you saw a fit within your research group. I told Niki that I would pass his cv along to you.

The customer is Latrove Steel. I'm going to call Peoples myself to learn how this works. Does anyone object to that? I will wait until this afternoon before I call. Heidi Do you think the production gas can be moved to EES's pool by July 1st? If not, we can sell the gas to Latrove out of CES's pool for July. However, we will not see the fuel credit until August(???) to verify if this works or not. Marde L 06/21/2000 08:29 PM cc: Alain Heidi Dick Nelson Mary Theresa Questions that I have: 1) I am assuming that the Clinton end-user will not go into EESs' pool. It needs to be verified with PNG that I can do a pool to pool nomination to the end-user (only a few stand alone customers are grandfathered to receive these types of noms.) This is a critical issue for EES as we are already long gas behind the gate and we don't need more production. If the customer can't take my gas from my pool then I will have to bring it in via CNG which will only make my pool longer. 2) If the production meters are moved to EESs' pool then I would suggest just a flat index price between ENA and EES. 3) Will EES be supplying the full 1000/d to the end-user or just the amount of the local production transferred to EESs' pool? 4) If the fuel credit works the way Chris explains it below then I would be willing to sell all of the gas at index but I will need to confirm that with PNG. cc: Marde L Alain Heidi Dick Nelson Mary Theresa 1. ENA is responsible for purchases of 500 MCFD (515 DthD) Metered Prouction from Phillips Production Company. This volume is will be decreased until further notice because PNG has increased line pressures thus reducing the production volumes to 50-60% of normal (Refer to attached schedule). There are 7 Phillips meters in CES's pool beginning July 2000. Heidi Boyd @ CES will have to nominate the production into CES's pool and away from the pool until the meters are moved. EES should have 6 Phillips Production meters in their pool beginning July 2000. 2. See Attached Schedule for Term, Price & Volume. Note: PNG has increased line pressures which reduces production into the system. Both Phillips Production and Power Gas Marketing are claiming Force Majeure. Their volumes have been reduced to 50-60% of the original contractd volume. Chris 06/20/2000 03:59 PM Heidi cc: Dick Here is what I'm looking at for July 1. Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer that can take around 1,000 day. I don't know if that's dt or mcf. I will use mcf for this email until someone corrects me. This customer has a special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the customer pulls. For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf credited back to your imbalance account the following month. I don't know how this works with trading imbalances. But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works out to $.21 - sounds good to me. Paul said this customer is looking for a CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number. Marde will not sell at that price but I will. Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing. Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES, settle up financially with EES and be done with it. What we could do to test Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for July. It would be easy to see since that is the only deal. AND, have EES take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing. Comments / Questions? Questions John 1. Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's pool. Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool? If yes, how many meters? 2. Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples Phillips Power Gas Marketing Term Price Volume Heidi (EES) If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to EES's pool for July. Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that. Marde I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer. At what price will you take these deals?

When we pull the ""MF"" book code with ""Financial"" as the region, we will be getting the liquidations for John Arnold's book, Mike Maggi's book, etc. We will have no way to determine which liquidations belong to which book. I just have a concern that if/when we have variances we would not be able to determine which trader's book was the cause of the variance.

State officials are pushing for Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison to accept a 10 percent rate increase, while the utilities are asking for a rate increase almost double that amount, the sources said. An accord, first reported in The Chronicle on Saturday, still could be announced any time this week, the sources said, noting that Gov. Gray Davis was maintaining pressure for the two sides to come to terms as quickly as possible. However, the sources said, both sides are digging in their heels as the talks intensify. The impasse makes it unlikely that the California Public Utilities Commission will lift a rate freeze affecting the two utilities at its meeting on Thursday, even though the matter already has been placed on the commission's agenda. ""Everyone is still trying to nail down different pieces of this mess,"" one source said. The negotiations began last week and continued through the weekend. However, sources familiar with the talks said PG&E and Edison were reluctant to compromise over how much they should be able to raise customers' bills and, in turn, how much of a combined $8 billion in outstanding debt the two utilities would have to swallow. Representatives of the utilities, the PUC and the governor's office declined to discuss the matter on the record yesterday. But sources said there was an increasing sense of urgency on the governor's part to extricate PG&E and Edison from their current financial woes and focus instead on California's chronic power shortages. State officials called a Stage 1 energy emergency yesterday afternoon as electricity reserves once again slipped to dangerously low levels. Large-scale industrial users were urged to reduce consumption. The governor is said to be eager to show some progress in tackling California's energy crisis, especially in light of measures announced by federal regulators on Friday that critics say do not go far enough. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission announced several steps intended to reduce volatility in wholesale power prices, but stopped short of a long- sought cap on wholesale rates. Davis said the commission ""abdicated its responsibility to the people in the West,"" while Sen. Dianne Feinstein characterized federal authorities as fiddling while Rome burns. Federal authorities will meet today in Sacramento with representatives of utilities and power companies, along with state politicians, to discuss ways to relieve California's energy shortage. Meanwhile, PG&E and Edison have warned of possible bankruptcy if they are unable to pass along to customers billions of dollars in extra costs accrued since wholesale power prices spiked over the summer. Because of the existing rate freeze, the two utilities so far have had to absorb all such costs as losses. Under terms of the deal now on the table, PG&E would absorb about half the roughly $5 billion in expenses it has incurred, while Edison would absorb a nearly equal percentage of its $3 billion in debt, sources said. The utilities, however, are fighting hard to pass on even more of the debt to customers in the form of higher rates, they said. PG&E held a special briefing for legislative aides in Sacramento yesterday at which utility officials made their case for a speedy bailout. ""They said they need to solve this, and they need to solve it now,"" said one participant in the meeting. But the officials were less forthcoming about how much the utility would compromise to find a workable solution. ""There wasn't a lot of wiggle room,"" the participant said. A source close to the PUC said state regulators would be ready to take up the matter of the rate freeze whenever a deal was reached with the utilities on how much customers' bills would go up. The source said the PUC probably would accept the utilities' argument that conditions for ending the rate freeze had been met months ago. The commissioners would then pass an emergency measure allowing rates to increase immediately. PUC President Loretta Lynch, who sources said was actively involved in the weekend negotiations, probably would introduce the emergency measure when a deal is reached. Swift approval by the five-member commission almost certainly would follow. ""If some kind of accord is reached, we will be morally obligated to go forward,"" one source said. Still, consumer activists blasted the pending deal yesterday, calling instead for all parties to hold their negotiations in the public arena. ""This is a gross violation of basic concepts of due process and fair play,"" said Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco. ""Utility rates in this state are supposed to be determined via a public process, not through back room deals between politicians and the utilities."" Added John Gamboa, executive director of San Francisco's Greenlining Institute: ""Back room deals are what led to our utility-backed deregulation scheme in the first place.""

We're as glad as anybody that it hasn't happened. I have a quick question: Your consultant for gas procurement, a fellow named Mark Baldwin, until recently did some consulting work for one of our business units, Transwestern gas pipeline. Mark has informed us that we won't be able to talk to him in his new role due to conflict of interest considerations that arise from our previous relationship with Mark. With that in mind, I was wondering if there is someone else working on gas procurement other than Mark (who doesn't face the same conflict issues) that we could meet with to discuss providing low-cost gas services to California? We're very cognizant of the importance of maintaining a conflict-free environment. But it would be a shame for the state to forego a good gas deal for the state's consumers. If there's someone we can talk to and avoid (even the appearance of) conflict-of-interest, we'd be very anxious to do so. Thanks for your time and hope all is well. Best, Jeff",Positive,2001

Within the UBS framework we will be creating a 'Transitional Steering Committee', 'Integration Committee' and 'Gas and Power Operating Committee'. UBS has already created the Integration Committee which we will merge into. Dave Forster will be attending all of these groups in the early weeks to ensure consistency and good communication. Dave will also act as our point person for Mark Bridges from UBS, ensuring the simplest and most effective methods of communication are in place for both parties.

Gas and Power Operating Committee: This committee will be responsible for the operational running of the Gas and Power Trading business. The initial focus of this group will be the re-starting of the business. Following the relaunch the purpose of the Management Committees will be to push through its strategic plans and targets globally, to be able to react to market changes quickly, and provide a forum for communication across all locations. These committees should also maintain, and develop further, any synergies between the Gas and Power Business and other UBS businesses.

Then we can do a conference call to explain the cuts? Just a suggestion. Thanks. Lynn Sent: Wednesday, September 19, 2001 3:07 PM Tim, I can't find a single date when LSP's overrun injections were cut completely. The LSP - Whitewater FDD contract has had 27 days this injection season where, at the end of the gas day, overrun injections are scheduled. I have found an example where USES tried to increase their nomination during the gas day. However all the available capacity had been scheduled during an earlier process cycle. When this occurs, no incremental injections can be scheduled unless incremental capacity becomes available. Another problem is that at the end of most gas days USES utilizes storage netting to further complicate the analysis. I really need more to go on. If USES can provide a date or dates it would help our analysis. Sent: Wednesday, September 19, 2001 10:47 AM << File: lspoverrun.xls >> Tim, Please find attached a summary showing the injection overrun volumes LSP scheduled on their FDD contracts 23281 and 23282 during the injection months of June, July and August 2001. Since the storage allocation is administered in Market Services, I have asked Mike Bodnar to look into specifics of the days allocated vs. LS Power's overrun volumes. I did do one quick spot check of a day where we allocated storage through the Intraday 2 process, and I found that LSP did indeed schedule injection overrun quantities on that day. Specifically, I looked at the gas day of September 1, 2001. I note that LSP schedule 7,825 mmbtu on an MDQ of 3,008 on contract 23281, and they scheduled 5,945 mmbtu on an MDQ of 3,560 on contract 23282 on Sept 1st. I'm not sure that it is accurate to say they are never getting any injection overrun on days we allocate storage. I can tell you that I think the allocation process is working correctly, but I'll let Mike speak to these issues further. Hope this helps! Kay Sent: Wednesday, September 19, 2001 7:58 AM Importance: High Kay, Bill Anderson from US Energy mentioned to Kent and I at the KC Operations meeting that his FDD injection overrun volumes are being cut completely when there is a storage allocation. At first, I thought this was due to a discounted injection overrun rate being charged to LS Power/Cogentrix. However, you confirmed yesterday that LS Power/Cogentrix is paying the full injection overrun rate, and therefore should get a pro-rata piece of the available capacity at the time of the allocation. I told Bill that we would look into our allocation process, and find out why LS Power/Cogentrix was being cut completely. Could you let me know if you find anything incorrect in our allocation process with regards to the LS Power/Cogentrix account? Perhaps LS Power/Cogentrix is entered into the allocation system incorrectly as a discounted rate? Please let me know what you find. I would like to respond to Bill as soon as possible. Thanks!!

Based on conversations with many of you, it appears the 192 Mdth/day of additional (572 Mdth/day total) capacity on Medicine Bow provided by this last segment commissioning will be sufficient to accomodate your transportation requirements until the entire project goes into service (anticipated late this month). For the month of October, the capacity contracted was approximatly 90% utilized, and we anticipate even greater utilization for November.

(changes 1st paragraph, adds details, company statement) SAN JOSE, Calif., July 6 (Reuters) - Independent power generator Calpine Corp. said on Friday that its contracts with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. will be altered, ensuring that Calpine will continue to supply power to the bankrupt California utility and that it will get paid more than $250 million for power already sold. Calpine stocks rose more than 14 percent, or more than $5, to $43 after the announcement. As part of the contract modification, the $267 million, with interest, that the utility, a unit of PG&E Corp , owes Calpine in past due receivables under the contracts, will be elevated to ""administrative priority status,"" a claim which is paid before any other general unsecured creditors. Calpine will get the money, in a lump sum, as soon as PG&E has a confirmed reorganization plan, which can take as long as four to six months from now, Calpine said. The move is also a step in the process of untangling California's energy crisis, which stemmed from a flawed deregulation plan that has hit the state with a series of rolling blackouts. Under the agreement, Calpine will continue to receive its contractual capacity payments, but it has also set up a fixed rate contract for the next five years of about 5.37 cents per kilowatt-hour. The contracts are known as qualifying facility contracts because Calpine's power plants are qualifying facilities. These types of facilities represent more than 20 percent of the state's power supply and sell power generated from renewable energy sources to the regulated utilities. ""Calpine is the first power company to modify its QF contract with PG&E to ensure that Northern California consumers will continue to benefit from these affordable and reliable energy resources,"" Calpine senior vice president James Macias said in a statement.",Positive,2001

Jennifer Sent: Wednesday, August 15, 2001 11:15 AM My contact, JR Rohrbaugh, called back. He says that ICAP was explicitily included in the market value of the plants in the model. The yearly market value had an energy componet and a capacity componet with the assumption that the capacity was compensation for installed capacity. This revenue, less incremental cost of running the plants was the annual cash value of the plants which was then present valued. That number less the book value was the stranded cost of the generation assets. Hope this helps. If Jim wants to talk to JR directly I have his number or e-mail.

The liquidation proceeding is an attempt to recover approximately $250 million Edison is in default on to CalPX market participants. Davis' Executive Order nullifies a Los Angeles County Superior Court decision that earlier today authorized CalPX to liquidate Edison's forward market positions. The following is excerpt from Governor Davis' Executive Order: It is ordered that the contracts and trades in the market for the sales and purchases of forward contracts and trades for electricity (known as the ""Block Forward"" market) for the delivery of electricity possessed by Southern California Edison Companyis hereby commandeered by the State of California to be held subject to the control and coordination of the State of California. CalPX will transfer the Edison contracts to the State of California. State law requires that the state shall pay ""the reasonable value thereof,"" and based on competitive market conditions today, CalPX determined the value of these contracts, for 2,846,000 megawatt hours, at over $651 million. - 30 - CalPX is a non-profit public benefit corporation established in 1998 with the passage of AB1890, which restructured the electric utility industry within the state of California.

Evelyn 05/02/2001 09:11 AM cc: I will check with Prebon asap. Kate Symes @ ECT 05/02/2001 10:56 AM cc: I double-checked with Bob, and he said Prebon reported these two trades as peak. The other two were in fact reported as off-peak - he just entered them incorrectly. But as far as this sleeve goes, there's no way one side is peak and the other isn't - Prebon has to make up their minds! Again, let me know what you find out. Until then, we recognize the two trades as they are. Thanks, Kate Evelyn 05/02/2001 08:59 AM cc: That's what I was confused about because Prebon shows this deal as peak and we show it as peak and I know it is the other side of a sleeve. Can you double check with Bob for accuracy. Evelyn Kate Symes @ ECT 05/02/2001 10:43 AM cc: Does this mean that 598738 should be off peak hours as well?

To launch the report, double click on the attachment and select Enable Macros and Read Only. Please note that: ERMS short names will be changed in GCP and ERMS each Friday at 10am Central Time, and Inactivations will be made on Feb 1 We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you. For more information, please click below: Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a detailed sheet (eg Jan 01). Click below for more information: The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date. If you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6. All changes made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically. The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection. This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly reformatted. Key points are: In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is listed in the Comments section As with the previous format, all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of the month. It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.

The methodology I used is as follows: (1) We each ended up with one exhibition game. (2) The two of you expressed a preference for weekend nights. There are 12 Friday and Saturday games, so I gave each of you six. (3) I tried to give you games where you will not be out of town (although I ended up giving each of you one game where both of you will be out of town). (4) I divided the teams into good teams (Trailblazers, Jazz, Heat, Spurs, Lakers, Knicks, Pacers and Sonics), medium teams (Timberwolves, Hornets, Kings, 76ers, Cavaliers, Suns, Celtics and Nets) and bad teams (Bulls, Pistons, Grizzlies, Wizards, Magic, Clippers, Mavericks, Bucks, Nuggets, Warriors, Raptors and Hawks), and I tried to divide the teams so that there was a realtively even distribution of team levels. Mark ended up with 5-7-6, Rob with 6-3-9 and I ended up with 2-1-2. Although Rob has one more good team than Mark has, he get to see more dogs. I am not 100% certain that I have a good handle on whose going to be good, mediocre and bad, and there were some teams that might be bad but I put in a medium category because they are interesting (e.g. 76ers, Celtics and Nets). (5) Finally, I attempted to minimize the repeats. But it ended up that Mark has the Timberwolves and Grizzlies twice, and Rob has the Warriors and Nuggets twice. And, of course, if you don't like what I did you can always trade. This was a highly scientific process, done with the aid of Lotus 1-2-3.

Additional score report requests will be processed for mailing to you and the designated institutions within one week after being received at ETS-GMAT. NOTE: Recipients indicated on an Additional Score Report Request Form cannot be changed or deleted. Unfortunately, we do not accept additional score report requests via e-mail or internet.

They exercised and sold, exercised and sold. And told all the employees to hold. While they made billions, they continued to say Our company will be the greatest someday. But lo and behold it would not come to pass. It was all a fraud and scam most would call crass. ""How could it be true?"" we all asked. ""All we do is buy and sell gas"". But to make their personal billions They had to keep in the dark their minions. So they lied and cheated, stole and cajoled Analysts, investors, workers and sold and sold. But they found out the scam And put the company in quite a stew. They told Ken and Andy ""we have lost confidence"". Little did they know, that confidence is what cons do. The old man in charge said ""we all trust Andy, he's fine, He made me my fortune and never charged a dime!"" Andy got paid to manage illegal partnerships you see, And for that he collected thirty m! illion as his fee. But the pressure was on, and Ken had to act. He told Andy, ""You must go on leave"" Is he still on the payroll we asked? We get no answer. Seems Andy will be there to the last. Ken restated his books, and oh the looks that Were on the faces of all but the crooks. The books had been cooked! Not one year, not two, not even three, They had been cooked a total of four. And many suspect even more!.. He went into the elevator, that old gas trader. He hit floor fifty, where his offices reside. With two armed guards standing at his side. And so he rose to the top of 1400 Smith And went into the boardroom forthwith. There were the ghosts of Fastow, and Skilling. Where with their cronies they devised great scams. How to deceive, cheat, and steal millions of clams. And with one more scam to do He picked up the phone and called his friend Chuck. ""Chuck"", he said, "" I'm in quite a jam, can! you please help me I got caught in my scam"". So old Chuck bit a nd came to Kens side, First with some money and took Ken as his bride. But that old scoundrel had played too many scams This one he could not hide as Chucks lawyers and guides Went over Ken's books and found such a surprise. There were no trades, there were no counterparties. There were no assets, there was no Christmas party. And so Chuck went to Ken and said ""Your company Is a sham. It was all lies. I cannot merge with you. Your firm is a rotting carcass festering with flies! And so Ken thought. He thought and he thought. He will file Chapter eleven and fire a lot. Four thousand to be exact. We thought he has lost gazillions, but prior filing he managed to bonus his friends fifty eight Million. And so we are told, the company will be back. A shell of itself but not quite the same.

The proceeding was somewhat productive, but turned into a witch hunt at a couple of points. Our view on this is: the problem is fairly straightforward (demand increases and new supplies are inhibited so prices go up and shortages ensue ... sound familiar?) and the solutions are straightforward (site the power plants suppliers are begging to build, let the utilities hedge outside the exchange, and finish the job of opening the interstate grid so power can get from where it is to where it is needed). What it comes down to at this point is FERC is the only entity with the authority to start fixing this problem now: Congress isn't going to get anything done this year and the California legislature is (thankfully) out of session now.

Re: LNG May 19 decision,vince.kaminski@enron.com,john.sherriff@enron.com,"Tue, 16 May 2000 01:48:00 -0700 (PDT)",<31709605.1075856929480.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"John, Sorry for the confusion. This is a second tanker on which very few details are available . The LNG group is working as we speak to provide some information for Joe Sutton before his departure for Paris this (Tuesday) afternoon. There is no DASH on this 2nd tanker yet. I asked Dave Gorte on Monday to send me one and was not told that he can provide me with the Mystic Lady DASH as the closest substitute. Vince John Sherriff 05/16/2000 12:20 AM cc: Vince - thanks for the update. What I am not sure of is what if any decision has to be made on May 19. It seems to me that the Mystic Lady and Elba Island deals have already been approved and executed - but it is quite likely I am missing a detail or two. John Vince J Kaminski 15/05/2000 17:14 cc: Vince J David Rick Ted John, This is the update on what I have done for the LNG transactions. 1. I was not involved in the LNG ship project. I shall read the DASH and give you my comments. Without looking at the details, I think that the decision to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island project (please, see point 2). 2. Elba Island. I am working with Doug Rotenberbg, Brad Hitch, Scott Earnest (Sally Beck's organization) and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island transaction. The next step will be to expand the book to capture all the Enron's LNG-related positions in one place and to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges. A working group is meeting to close a few remaining gaps tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30. A few comments on the book design and my view of the project: a. The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island facility by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis. Marginal cargos will represent supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long-term contracts or became available due to some short-term frictions. The fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the long-term contract prices. The economics of the deal, as represented by the book we are setting up, will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal cargos but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis, arranging shipping and coordinating the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US. In other words, we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction. b. The transaction will cover the period of 17 years (with an extension option of 5 years). Even if we can lock-in the LNG volumes over this time period, we have no ability to lock-in the other side of the spread (US gas prices) for such a long tenor. This is essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG - nat gas spread and I would not recommend locking-in only one leg of the spread. One solution would be to cover, let's say, 50% of he LNG volumes for the first 5 years and lock-in the nat gas side on the US market side. c. The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions regarding sources of LNG, shipping rates, schedules, etc. I would set up a big prudence reserve in case we mark it to market. d. My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island deal (that are good for Enron) and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions. Long-term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail that correlates very well with Brent. Vince John Sherriff 05/14/2000 01:40 AM cc: Lauren Vince I haven't spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well. Anyway with Greg moving to his new role I have (I hope only temporarily) staff trading oversight for the Eastern Hemishere plus LNG. I understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for LNG and LNG ship values. I also understand that another LNG ship decision is on the dockets for May 19 (not very far away). Anway I understand this is a big decision but I still have gotten very little info yet. Can you please let me know where you stand now? I will ask my assistant Lauren to set up a time that I can speak with you in the next couple of days and if you have anything for me to review before then she can get it faxed to me as well.

I did manage to run some errands (something productive). Anne (tall blonde that was at the happy hour) and I went to Liberty Noodles for dinner and then hit the downtown bar scene -- totally boring. (Anne is single these days if you want me to hook you up). Sunday, more brunching and then Anne and I went to see Mission Impossible 2...Tom Cruise is still totally hot and i didn't mind watching him for two hours. That was it. Not very exciting. We should try and do something this weekend. I have another happy hour Friday night but other than that no plans. This week is pretty busy. I'm starting to panic. Gotta run. By the way....how are you getting around these days? Gerald 06/06/2000 04:54 PM cc: How is it going? Did you have a fun weekend? My weekend was, although enjoyable, challenging. First Eric's wife got sick Friday night and wasn't able to go out the whole weekend. Next, my car battery completely died when I arrived at my friends house in Austin. I replaced the battery and everything was fine. Eric, I, and my friend proceeded to Maggie Maes to see the band Pale (the whole point of our trip, right!). We arrived at Maggie Maes and asked which level Pale was playing on and were informed they had cancelled. Great. Oh well we had a good time that night anyway. Cool.

(the utilities ask) You'd think the utilities would have better things to spend their time on. Actually, SCE most likely benefits (pays off its debts sooner) if it can capture more customers. These are similar to issues Commissioner Wood is investigating and may result in a decision along those lines that goes to the Commission for a vote.

But, four bad years is worth the political message it will send, especially if it's strong. People must perish in wars of belief!

We have covered the following investments to date on Cuiaba. EPE $235MM GASMAT $ 60MM GASBOL $132MM Up to US$200MM could be reimbursed for an insuarble event. However, that $200 may be limited by draws associated with insurable events at other projects. This $200MM could be further limited by draws from other projects because the program has a cap of $250MM total, but the cap can be reinstated following a draw with an exclusion for the country where the previous hit occurred.

With the current Shell/enron sharing percentages, it would seem that we are entitled to 72% of the $360 MM payment or $259 MM, thus we would only be out by $59 MM.

The idea is to file a brief joinder stating that the Participants' Committee in the CalPX case, representing constituents which are the real parties in interest of over $1.9 billion in claims against PG&E, as scheduled by PG&E in its list of 20 largest creditors, supports the motion and the joinder filed by the PG&E creditors' committee. Our joinder would state that there is no statutory basis for appointing a ratepayers' committee and that it is not in the best interest of the estate. We might also indicate that we agree with PGE and the PGE creditors' committee that there are other means for ratepayers to be heard which make more sense than giving them official committee status.

It would be difficult to rearrange the meeting at this point, given that it was timed around the availability of Jeff Skilling. I doubt we could get Jeff for any other date at this point. We can still adjust the agenda to discuss and address the Content Services issues. I shall work on this with John and Ravi. Vince cc: Technical Forum I could probably make Friday but would have to leave that night. Any chance it could be moved to the first of the next week. Also, I think it is important that as we examine the technical issue of our network and network functionality that we balance the meeting with the Content Services issues and requirements. I talked to John about this already. Vince J 03/27/00 02:58 PM cc: Vince J Stinson Shirley John Griebling/Enron Communications Forum Joe, I would like to invite you to an off-site meeting of John Griebling's organization and the Research Group. Location: Breckenridge, Colorado As you know, John Griebling is managing the network design and construction project currently under way in EBS. The Research Group is actively involved in this effort which requires advanced quantitative skills in the area of stochastic optimization and stochastic processes (for modeling and forecasting Internet traffic flows). The objective of this meeting is to develop common language and accomplish transfer of skills between the two groups, to facilitate cooperation on this project in the future. We are inviting Ken Rice and Kevin Hannon to this meeting. We would appreciate if you could speak, together with Kevin and Ken, on strategic directions of EBS. It is important for a group of technical people, with relatively specialized technical skills, to understand the big picture. I am attaching the preliminary agenda for this meeting.

Barton 01/08/2001 10:09 AM cc: As Rusty suggests, do you have a copy of an agreement between ENA ( or any affiliate thereof) and George Hessler re sound consulting services? I have been asked to put together an agreement between Hessler and Fort Pierce Repowering Project LLC, and don't know who Hessler is or what terms Hessler may have consulted under in the past. Rusty was not particularly helpful in this regard. I will call the consultant directly if we don't have something already available.

I don't have the contract we use with George Hessler, but he has been used for numerous projects at Enron. I think Kay Mann or Sheila would have a copy of his base agreement, and I'm not sure we ever did an amendment or whatever for this job. We can always call George and ask him for a copy of his agreement 703-753-1602. Barton 01/05/2001 12:56 PM cc: One of the services agreements we discussed the other day that I needed to draft or review was the Hessler Sound Services agreement. Can you forward me what we have on that? Also, we discussed the 4 agreements I initialled for signature that apparently were never signed, 2 with LBFH, 1 with Lucido, and 1 with ECT. The LBFH and Lucido had the counterparty's original signatures, and the LBFH were in duplicate originals. I understand this work has been kicked off, and we need to get something signed asap. Re the form of these agreements, I did not use the usual ENA forms because we were trying to put together something in a hurry and we had the originals signed by the counterparties so we used an attachment to incorporate some essential terms. I would like to get the unsigned originals back to look over if they have not yet been signed, and if they have been signed, I would like copies. I have been requested to put together a file of all executed agreements by FPRP, or agreements proposed to be executed, and I did not keep copies of these four contracts.",Neutral,2001

"RE: Angelides Oct. 19th Letter to L. Lynch Urging July 1 DA
Suspension Date",jeff.dasovich@enron.com,ek@a-klaw.com,"Mon, 22 Oct 2001 13:58:00 -0700 (PDT)",<11950691.1075851627703.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Suspension Date Great question. If you think it would be useful, I can back channel to Loretta and find out. I'm of the view that this letter is more to refute Angelides, so that his wild assertions don't go unanswered in the court of public opinion. Perhaps the letter should be addressed to Angelides, instead. On the other hand, I think it is also useful to make it known to the press and the public that the PUC has the regulatory tools, processes, etc. necessary to permit customers broad latitude to manage their own energy needs on the one hand, and ensure that there's not the sort of massive cost-shifting to which Angelides refers on the other. In the public's view this has been painted as an either/or issue. Either we end direct access, or granny faces death and destruction. And that's just not the case. In fact, I think it can be argued that the scenario Angelides paints just isn't in the cards, period. But I may be missing the mark with all this and am open to other views. Let me know if you'd like me to find out if Loretta thinks the letter would help her. Could find that out in pretty short order. Best, Jeff Sent: Monday, October 22, 2001 3:46 PM Suspension Date Has anyone ever stopped to ask Loretta whether the letters are helpful or not? Two things occur to me. First, it is not becoming for a commissioner to be taking actions consistent with the urgings of industry -- particularly if you're a Democrat. Second, it has always struck me that what she needs is some form of record support, not political pats on the back in one-page letters. I am asking you these questions not judging the proposal to send a letter .... but I've never understood what they're supposed to do for her and I honestly would like to understand. E Sent: Monday, October 22, 2001 11:33 AM Suspension Date FYI. Note below that even the mighty and powerful Power Authority's own crackerjack analysis asserts that there is still a net short (despite DWR contracts and DA ""stampede""), which should leave one to believe that, contrary to Angelides' letter, the more the DA the better. Which further supports Loretta Lynch's response to the Angelides' letter that DA reduces the amount of spot power DWR has to buy. Best, Jeff CONSUMER POWER AND CONSERVATION FINANCING AUTHORITY Pace of Power Authority Renewable Portfolio Agenda is Slowed Quite possibly the most significant action taken at the October 19 Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority (Power Authority) was its inaction on contracts proposed for approval. The Power Authority has aggressively pursued a broad renewable portfolio, with the intent to approve contracts as soon as possible. Instead of approving a number of contracts on its October 19 agenda, the Power Authority deferred calendared decisions on request for bids until its November 2 meeting, acknowledging that no action can be taken until the Department of Water Resources (DWR) rate agreement stalemate has been resolved. Chairman Freeman stated that the Public Utility Commission's rejection of the rate agreement has created an obstacle for the Power Authority to exercise renewable contracts, to contract for peaker generation and/or to implement demand side programs. The Power Authority relies upon DWR's credit to fund these programs, and until a rate agreement is finalized the Power Authority cannot sign contracts. Freeman indicated that the Power Authority has signed letters of intent to purchase output from 14 biomass facilities in the Central Valley, as well as 400 MW generated by wind. With the Current Glut of Contracts, Why Do We Need Additional Reserves? Kellan Flukinger, Senior Advisor to Chairman Freeman and Laura Doll, provided a detailed presentation explaining why he believes the Power Authority must contract for additional renewable and peaking generation. Flukinger believes that despite direct access and the current glut of electricity supplied in long-term contracts, there still appears to be a net short of a few thousand megawatts within the State. Flukinger concluded that the State still is at the mercy of electric generators who are not subject to PUC regulatory authority and who have no real obligation to build and maintain new facilities or to serve customers within the State. He believes that the short-term contracts and spot purchases leave the state vulnerable to price-spikes and supply shortages. He believes that the reserve can be managed through Time-of-Use and Real-Time-Pricing, conservation, interruptibles, demand side management, renewables and peakers.

Vince Sent: Wednesday, June 06, 2001 5:24 AM Thanks Vince... We'll be auctioning off transmission rights in these corridors in September (assuming FERC approves our filing), which confronts traders with a complex array of valuation problems (the long-term value of the right to ship energy along these DC pathways and to collect ancillary services in each of the markets). It's a conceptually difficult challenge for most companies but I'm sure Enron is all over it. We'll be interested in whether or not Enron's traders participate in this auction. We are also pre-selling some of the capacity in negotiations over the summer, in the expectation of FERC approval of that concept (kind of an anchor tenant concept). As you will recall, we did approach Enron early on in the project (a fellow in Calgary whose name I cannot remember) and he indicated no interest. I'll keep you in the loop because I suspect you'll find the intellectual challenge intriguing -- what is access to DC capacity worth? --- as I do. Hope things are going well in all of your markets! Ed Sent: Monday, June 04, 2001 12:31 PM Hello Ed, It sounds very interesting. I forwarded your messages to two members of my group who work on the problems related to transmission (a key to the power markets successful growth). I shall share with you their reaction.

Ron will be trying to set up a call. Ron was wondering what or how we wanted Gov R. to handle the information.

Harrington is the key--he is a retired military guy and one of the lead govt. contracts lawyers at my old firm in DC. The would basically put on a dog and pony walking us all through their sole source strategy, including their legal interpretations and the allies they have lined up within DOE/DOD. Bill and Bill--does such a meeting sound productive? If so, should we have outside govt. contracts counsel present and if so, who do you suggest? On a related note, Tino explained (without me asking or really caring) that he was in the middle of a ""big drafting project""--revising Dennis' joint venture agreement with the Isleta. I took the opportunity to express my concern at how far down the road Dennis is getting on the overall deal, including structure issues, without knowing whether Enron is even on board. I reminded Tino that GPG has not committed to participating in the pipeline or the power plant, and that we have not obtained ENA's agreement to commit turbines. Apparently Dennis believes that if the economics pans out, Enron or someone else yet to be identified will magically jump in to the deal with money, turbines, etc. If Enron does eventually decide to get into this deal, the agreements and promises that Dennis has already made may need to be revisited.

He is currently an assistant professor in our program and a highly valued member of our department. We hate to lose him, however his interest has shifted from the academic arena to one of high level but practical application and development of statistical methodologies including stochastic modeling. Keith is actually a graduate of our Ph.D. program; he was in the same group of students as Martin Lawera. Keith spent several years at Los Alamos National Lab before we recruited him back to Rice. He has been on our faculty now for three years and it is my expectation (and that of my colleagues) that if he remained he would receive tenure. Keith has a strong interest in financial models and the background to support his interest. He is also a leading expert in statistical computing, empirical likelihood, categorical models and areas of statistics falling under the general bailiwick of ""data mining"". He is a creative thinker. I do not know if there are possibilities for Keith within your group, however I believe it is an excellent match of talent and objectives.

We have narrowed our choice of vehicles to two minivans: a Toyota Sienna and a Chrysler Town & Country. Surprisingly, Ben helped us eliminate SUV's from consideration. He prefers the smoother ride of the minivan. It will be better for taking long trips. The down side is he doesn't want to be seen driving a minivan once he turns 16. Ha! : ) We were able to help satisfy Anna (and Ben) by choosing a higher-end minivan that has many ""bells and whistles"" on it, yet still costs less than an SUV. We are leaning toward the Toyota, even though it is a bit smaller than the Chrysler, because of its reliability and how it holds its resale value. The Toyota dealer also has ""$300 over invoice"" sale on currently. Plus they told Mark there will be additional financing incentives starting this Saturday. Both the Toyota and Chrysler dealers have vehicles in inventory we can choose from. So, we hope to close the deal with the Toyota dealer this coming Saturday. What do you think?

Eric, our biggest concern with this right now is the valuation for the Products that you would see in your Position Summary. We know that is we passed these trades through the system as a straight month-long transaction, that the valuation would be wrong. Additionally, the start and end dates will skue the valuation based on which day of the week the first calendar day of the month falls on and which day of the week the last calendar day of the month falls on. Using a straight 5/7 valuation methodology is only going to get you 'close' to true value in the Position Summary. Hence, the specs sent to Mike that you see in the e-mail below will need to be built. In short, Eol was not set up to readily accept this valuation methodology. We will get you as close as we can, and we will give you some idea of how close these Position Values will be.

This landmark program, already underway, will be assisted by many dedicated volunteers from throughout the community. Led by Chairman Gene Vaughan, the Center, an affiliate of the Greater Houston Partnership, is focused on very tough questions: The world and Houston are changing rapidly - what will be the new reality in 20 years and beyond? What do we want Houston to be? What are the obstacles and trade-offs? Most of all, what plans, resources, determination and leadership are necessary now to get Houston to its desirable future? If you are interested in what can be done to give Houston a great future worthy of its past - and particularly if you want to get involved - this is an outstanding opportunity to discourse with one of the citizens leading the charge. Gene Vaughan is chairman and founder of Vaughan, Nelson, Scarborough & McCullough, L.P., an investment management firm originated in Houston in 1970 whose Investment Counsel and VNSM Trust Company manage securities portfolios for foundations, endowments, corporations and families. Within his profession, Mr. Vaughan was founding chairman and governor of the Association for Investment Management and Research, a past chairman of the Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts and a past chairman of the Financial Analysts Federation. He is chairman and has served as a director since 1970 of Dreyfus Founders Group of mutual funds (Denver). Mr. Vaughan has been a trustee of Vanderbilt University (Nashville) since 1972. He is a director since 1990 and on the Executive Committee of the Greater Houston Partnership. He is Chairman of the Center for Houston=01,s Future whose mission is to help prepare Houston proactively for future opportunities and challenges. Mr. Vaughan is a director of the Houston Grand Opera Association, a trustee of Goodwill Industries and past chairman of The Houston Forum. He was founding chairman of Presbyterian School (early childhood through grade 8) and served as a trustee of St. John=01,s= =20 School. Mr. Vaughan received a B.A. in 1955 from Vanderbilt University, an M.B.A. in 1961 from the Harvard Business School, where he was a J.

Unfortunately, we are not able to do any major construction to densify the floor during the next several months while Enron Property Services is completing the build-out of levels 29, 31 and 32. In the mean time, we are going to build out the window spaces on 30 to increase the capacity on the floor. While these locations are not prime spots, people will need to occupy them as our business continues to grow. Once the window seats have been constructed (estimated to be 2-3 weeks), we will realign groups on the floor and people will need to move once again. I am requesting your cooperation and patience to work with Lisa Cousino while she works with space planners to coordinate the location of Energy Operations personnel on the newly-constructed Commercial floors. Susan Harrison is working with Lisa to manage the space planning on 30 during this transition period. Chantelle Villanueva will be coordinating all moves of people and equipment on the 30th floor. If there are any problems once a move has occurred (i.e., missing or non-working phones, boxes, computer equipment, printers, etc.), please contact Chantelle at Ext. 3-6279 as she will also coordinate the follow-up on all move-related items. If Chantelle is not available, Maria Sandoval will be her backup. Maria can be reached at Ext. 3-5586. I would also appreciate your help in cleaning up the floor, including the window spaces. We can no longer maintain unnecessary boxes, paper and supplies on the floor. Please coordinate with your assistant to have your area cleaned up by December 31. During this clean-up process, if you have any documents that need to be filed and/or archived, please contact Carolyn Gilley in the Information and Records Management group at Ext. 3-5237 and she will make arrangements to pick up the information from the 30th floor. Thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation in maintaining a neat and professional work environment. Between now and the summer of 2001 when we will relocate to the new building, please keep in mind that we are all working in a temporary and makeshift environment. I would greatly appreciate your patience and good humor as we struggle to use the available space effectively.

Re: Rockets Playoff Tickets - Response needed this week.,mark.haedicke@enron.com,rbaird@velaw.com,"Tue, 27 Mar 2001 06:40:00 -0800 (PST)",<27581103.1075845062602.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Bob: I am going to pass on the playoff tickets. Thanks. Mark ""Baird, Bob"" 03/27/2001 01:45 PM ""Rob Walls (E-mail)"" cc: Mark and Rob: Rockets have been looking good (despite the recent slump) and have a chance to make the playoffs. (I heard on the radio this morning that Hakeem may be back.) So the Rockets have sent out invoices for playoff tickets. We are supposed to respond by this Friday, March 30. This year (perhaps because they know there's a decent chance they won't make the playoffs) the Rockets are invoicing playoff tickets in two installments. The first installment covers rounds one and two, and the second covers the Western Conference Finals and the NBA Championship. I can't tell whether if you commit for the first two rounds you have a legal obligation to buy the second and third if they make it to the Western Conference Finals, but I assume that doesn't matter (we should assume that a commitment now means a financial commitment for the entire playoffs). Rounds 1 and 2 encompass 6 games. $549 per seat, or $2,196 total. That's two games in Round 1 at $88.50 per ticket, and four games in Round 2 at $93.00 per ticket. Rounds 3 and 4 (which we wouldn't have to pay for until later) are $916 per seat, or $3,664. I assume that Rounds 3 and 4 will include 8 games. For the regular season I had 6/44 of the tickets, which is 13.6%. That's approximately 1 ticket in Rounds 1 and 2 and 1 ticket in Rounds 3 and 4. I'd be glad to spring for that, although if you all want all the playoff tickets that's fine also. So I suppose how much it's going to cost each of you depends on whether my ticket is Round 1 or 2. If it's in round 2 each of you would pay $912 for the first two rounds, and if it's in round 1 each of you would pay $921. If the two of you want all the playoff tickets, each of you would pay $1,098 for Rounds 1 and 2. This year the Rockets are saying that if the tickets are not used you can ask for a refund by the same means that you paid. So what I would propose to do it put all the charges on my credit card and if they don't make the playoffs that charge will be reversed; and it may not even make it on my bill if they don't make the playoffs. Since I will put it on my card I won't need your money until about the 20th of April. So please let me know if you want to commit and whether you want me to take a ticket out of each of the sets of rounds. (I'm fine either way) Robert S. Baird Vinson & Elkins L.L.P.

It is NOT guaranteed bonus over and above salary (I wish it was). Basically, I am 95% certain I will make a minimum of 600K/year with either company, worst case I'm looking at 500K/year (excluding incentive). Incentive would be in addition to. My offer would have to be in that ballpark. If I worked 1/3 the year, assuming a base salary in the 250 to 300 range, I would get 100 less. Also, I'm not trying to be vague. Essentially I'm working with 3 moving parts--non of which has become crystal clear yet. At this point, let's look at this: 2-year contract with an out after 1-year. $275 base salary. $225 signing bonus. $225 retention bonus after 1-year. If I take it, I'm done for another year. Participation in the 17% incentive package. Relocation package. That seems to be the ballpark we are in. Thanks, Sean Sent: Thursday, May 24, 2001 7:57 AM Thanks. My last question. If you start on Sep 1 do you get 600k by Feb 1, 2002? That is if you are working for a 1/3 or the year do you get that kind of bonus guaranteed? Sean, I'm not trying to be a pain but I have a simple style when it comes to hiring, I just need to know exactly how everything fits together. If you do not wish to reveal that it your choice. I tried to get the best package put together so there is not a lot of games. I'm not sure we can match those numbers and ultimately Tim McCabe will have to make that call, but it helps if its a clear as possible. It sounds like you have a lot of great opportunities. We are having meeting today to discuss the trading situation. I will keep you posted. Sent: Thursday, May 24, 2001 9:33 AM Hey Bruce, The 600 and 725 are guaranteed, yes. I didn't mean to imply Cinergy wouldn't pay out; I meant more i'm basically comparing startup prospects with established company/operations prospects. Startup prospects are, I think, more risky. Also, I realize there are distinct advantages from living in Houston. My ""reluctance"" is more of a family/moving type of thing. It is an issue, but not a huge one. Thanks, Sean [mailto:IMCEANOTES-+22Sukaly+2C+20Bruce+22+20+3Cbruce+2Esukaly+40cinergy+2Ec Sent: Wednesday, May 23, 2001 3:54 PM Thanks for the update. I will forward this information. I assume that the low numbers are guaranteed that no matter what happens to you or the company you will receive the min amount. Is that true? As far as Cinergy having a payout record- it does. The bonus plan pays out 17% of profits, I don't think there is any other company paying that kind of money. They paid on it last year. However, the P&L has to be there, but the money was distributed. Also they pay on NPV of the deals so accounting doesn't enter into performance. I think that is unique as well. As far as Houston goes, I can show you parts of the city that are beautiful and the commute is easy with lots of great neighborshood at tremendous value. I'm 15 minutes from every venue (sport, education, theatre, musuems) in the fourth largest city in America. In addition, your family will not be trapped to one employer. I lived in a few places and visited numerous others, I think its the best value city in the country. In addition, with the kind of money you will be making there is no state income in Texas. And being in the energy trading business, it has no peer. Sent: Wednesday, May 23, 2001 5:14 PM Down to brass tacks, eh? This is always the interesting part. Quite frankly Bruce, it's a pretty good job market. Basically I'm looking at two other prospects. The first will require me to sign a 2-year contract, the second will not. The base component with the first is going to be around $275/year. The second is going to be around $250/year. As far as incentive bonus goes, I'm looking at about a minimum of $450 for the first to about a max of $750. At the second I'm looking at a min of about $350 to about a max of $900. So over a one year period, we're looking at about $725 to $1.025M for prospect 1, and $600 To $1.15M for prospect 2. In terms of location, both prospect 1 and 2 are in attractive locations for me. Prospect 1 is in a VERY attractive location. To be honest, I'm not a big buyer of Houston, so I have to factor that into the equation. Secondly, both prospects are big, well entrenched players, so I'm pretty confident of the above numbers. While I'm pretty excited about the prospects of being on the ""ground floor"" with Cinergy, I also have to recognize Cinergy doesn't have a P&L track record for me to assess the probability of the incentive payout. For that reason, I think, I would require a fairly large guaranteed number the first year, while still participating in Cinergy's incentive program. The second year I would be willing to renegotiate the guaranteed number if we had our feet underneath us and it looked like we had the room to prove ourselves and generate some serious money for the company. Given what you guys have in mind, I honestly think I can help you achieve your goals more quickly, and with less risk. I also think there is serious money to be made with the right team--I've seen it happen at Enron. No matter what happens, I appreciate you taking the time. Please also extend my thanks to everyone I had the opportunity to meet in Cincinnati.

Finally, below is an interesting article about the real cost of the contracts. Connell: Power cost twice Davis' figure July 6, 2001 By JOHN HOWARD The Orange County Register SACRAMENTO -- The average cost of electricity purchased under $43 billion of worth of state contracts is actually more than double the amount reported by Gov. Gray Davis' administration, state Controller Kathleen Connell said Thursday. Connell said her staff's analysis put the per-megawatt average at $170, compared with $69 to $79 estimated by Davis. Connell stopped short of suggesting that the higher cost could drive another increase in rates, although consumer groups said the higher amount likely would require some future increase. The controller, who writes the state's checks, said her figures assume fixed prices for natural gas over the duration of the contracts, which range from a few months to 20 years. The administration, noting that nearly half its contracts are pegged to the fluctuating market price of natural gas, said costs on many of the contracts would decline over time. Consumer groups were skeptical of the administration's numbers. ""You could cut these numbers in various ways and make different averages, long-range or short-range contracts, peak power or nonpeak, and probably either average could be defended mathematically,"" said Nettie Hoge of The Utility Reform Network. ""We can't tell you whether it's $69 or $170 - the contracts are very convoluted and complex.""",Neutral,2001

May be useful for Thursday's meeting. Best, Jeff Sent: Friday, September 28, 2001 5:27 PM Here's a cut at the taxonomy of regulatory risks associated with Direct Access. Please let us know if the list looks about right. FYI: Sue and I are scheduled to travel to Portland to sit down with Steve Swain & Co. in the attempt to ensure that the folks managing the book are well briefed on the regulatory risks. Finally, note that though the risks listed below are linked to PUC actions, the California Legislature could take actions that could trigger the same risks. For example, the Legislature could pass a bill directing the PUC how to allocate costs associated with the utilties' undercollection, the bonds issued to recover general fund money used to purchase power, DWR's long term contracts, etc. Best, Jeff 1. Retroactive Suspension of DA Contracts: The PUC rules in a subsequent decision that DA is suspended on some date between July 1 and September 20th. 2. Contract renewal forbidden: The PUC includes contract renewal under the suspension of DA. 3. No incremental ""DASR'ing"": The PUC includes incremental additions and subtractions of DA customer's load under the suspension of DA (e.g., fast food chains, University campus) 4. Cost allocation: The PUC adds new costs to DA accounts and/or disproportionately shifts existing costs to DA accounts. Costs with the greatest risk of being shifted to DA customers include: IOU undercollection, bonds to repay the state general fund, and DWR contracts. The costs associated with these categories are substantial. 5. [Added 10.01.01] Retroactive end to rate freeze: The utilities assert that the rate freeze ended as far back as May 2000 and have sued the PUC in court, asking the court to direct the PUC to end it. Additional suggestions from Mike Day: 5. DASR processing : If the utilities attempt to implement the Commission-ordered suspension in an onerous way, it may put at risk [Dasovich, Jeff] ontracts executed prior to 09.20.01 but not yet DASR'd. 6.

In California peak demand rose by about 5500 MW from 1996 - 2000. The market responded with porposed capacity additions of about 11000 MW. Most of these facilities are working thier way through the tangle of state and local approvals. The problems we saw in California did not need to occur if policy makers simply enabled the market to work. Also, it's worth noting that the deregulated market did work. Customers who signed with Enron saw a lower bill than prederegulation, Enron hedged its commitments and so our customers (and Enron) did just fine during the summer. Deregulation worked; the problems in California can be directly traced to continued regulatory interference in the market. Susan J Mara 11/17/2000 06:09 PM cc: Bruno Christopher J Day/Govt.

A valve was left open between an LG&E facility and Northern for an approximate 3 month period (I'm not sure how recent). LG&E's gas loss data indicates that the amount of gas that inadvertently got into Northern was approx. 180,000 MMBtu, with a value of about $500,000. Rockey and Steve have talked to LG&E and it does not appear that we have any good arguments for avoiding the liability. The unexpected (and unmetered) deliveries from LG&E presumably reduced our lost and unaccounted for balance during the referenced 3 month period. Accordingly, I assume the cost of replacing that gas should be accounted for in Northern's PRA and so should not affect earnings. I'm not sure what the timetable is for resolving this matter.

Some of the outstanding issues could reduce this negative somewhat. We should have a better feel by Thurs. Overall, I want to reflect fair value on the re-books, not extreme conservatism. For example, on TYCO, I will not use NY Zone A for revenue purposes if the contract is unclear and does not force us to do this.

However, if we are to maintain growth levels, we need to focus very closely on our cost base and create more efficiencies in the current round of Enron Corp. budget reviews. We are analysing much more closely exactly which businesses we derive our earnings from and concentrating our resources on those areas. We will be taking decisions to put some projects on the ""back burner""and reduce the scope of others. This will inevitably mean that we need to reduce our headcount both in commercial and commercial support groups as we seek to identify the best mix of skills to keep us on our earnings growth track. To this end we will be seeking to cut our headcount in Europe by between five and ten percent, but we will aim as far as possible to achieve this through a program of voluntary severance. Details of this program will be made available by Monday 8th October. We hope to complete this exercise and communicate the outcome as quickly as possible in October so that everyone knows where they stand. Please feel free to contact either of us, but also talk to your supervisor about any specific concerns you may have and remember that you can also make use of the LifeWorks confidential counselling service that is available on 0800 169 1920.

We don't know when the service will be reinstated; but in the meantime you can reflect on what life was like before the darn thing was invented. Bell, Alexander Graham b. , March 3, 1847, Edinburgh d. Aug. 2, 1922, Beinn Bhreagh, Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Can. Scottish-born American audiologist best known as the inventor of the telephone (1876). For two generations his family had been recognized as leading authorities in elocution and speech correction, with Alexander Melville Bell's Standard Elocutionist passing through nearly 200 editions in English. Young Bell and his two brothers were trained to continue the family profession. His early achievements on behalf of the deaf and his invention of the telephone before his 30th birthday bear testimony to the thoroughness of his training. Alexander (""Graham"" was not added until he was 11) was the second of the three sons of Alexander Melville Bell and Eliza Grace Symonds Bell. Apart from one year at a private school, two years at Edinburgh's Royal High School (from which he was graduated at 14), and attendance at a few lectures at Edinburgh University and at University College in London, Bell was largely family trained and self-taught. His first professional post was at Mr. Skinner's school in Elgin, County Moray, where he instructed the children in both music and elocution. In 1864 he became a resident master in Elgin's Weston House Academy, where he conducted his first studies in sound. Appropriately, Bell had begun professionally as he would continue through life--as a teacher-scientist. In 1868 he became his father's assistant in London and assumed full charge while the senior Bell lectured in America. The shock of the sudden death of his older brother from tuberculosis, which had also struck down his younger brother, and the strain of his professional duties soon took their toll on young Bell. Concern for their only surviving son prompted the family's move to Canada in August 1870, where, after settling near Brantford, Ont., Bell's health rapidly improved. In 1871 Bell spent several weeks in Boston, lecturing and demonstrating the system of his father's Visible Speech, published in 1866, as a means of teaching speech to the deaf. Each phonetic symbol indicated a definite position of the organs of speech such as lips, tongue, and soft palate and could be used by the deaf to imitate the sounds of speech in the usual way. Young A. Graham Bell, as he now preferred to be known, showed, using his father's system, that speech could be taught to the deaf. His astounding results soon led to further invitations to lecture. Even while vacationing at his parents' home Bell continued his experiments with sound. In 1872 he opened his own school in Boston for training teachers of the deaf, edited his pamphlet Visible Speech Pioneer, and continued to study and tutor; in 1873 he became professor of vocal physiology at Boston University. Never adept with his hands, Bell had the good fortune to discover and inspire Thomas Watson, a young repair mechanic and model maker, who assisted him enthusiastically in devising an apparatus for transmitting sound by electricity. Their long nightly sessions began to produce tangible results. The fathers of George Sanders and Mabel Hubbard, two deaf students whom he helped, were sufficiently impressed with the young teacher to assist him financially in his scientific pursuits. Nevertheless, during normal working hours Bell and Watson were still obliged to fulfill a busy schedule of professional demands. It is scarcely surprising that Bell's health again suffered. On April 6, 1875, he was granted the patent for his multiple telegraph; but after another exhausting six months of long nightly sessions in the workshop, while maintaining his daily professional schedule, Bell had to return to his parents' home in Canada to recuperate. In September 1875 he began to write the specifications for the telephone. On March 7, 1876, the United States Patent Office granted to Bell Patent Number 174,465 covering ""The method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically . . . by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sounds."" Within a year followed the commercial application and, a few months later, the first of hundreds of legal suits. Ironically, the telephone--until then all too often regarded as a joke and its creator-prophet as, at best, an eccentric--was the subject of the most involved patent litigation in history. The two most celebrated of the early actions were the Dowd and Drawbaugh cases wherein the fledgling Bell Telephone Company successfully challenged two subsidiaries of the giant Western Union Telegraph Company for patent infringement. The charges and accusations were especially painful to Bell's Scottish integrity, but the outcome of all the litigation, which persisted throughout the life of his patents, was that Bell's claims were upheld as the first to conceive and apply the undulatory current. In 1877 Bell married Mabel Hubbard, 10 years his junior. The Bell story does not end with the invention of the telephone; indeed, in many ways it was a beginning. A resident of Washington, D.C., Bell continued his experiments in communication, which culminated in the invention of the photophone--transmission of sound on a beam of light; in medical research; and in techniques for teaching speech to the deaf. In 1880 France honoured Bell with the Volta Prize; and the 50,000 francs (roughly equivalent to U.S. $10,000) financed the Volta Laboratory, where, in association with Charles Sumner Tainter and his cousin, Chichester A. Bell, Bell invented the Graphophone. Employing an engraving stylus, controllable speeds, and wax cylinders and disks, the Graphophone presented a practical approach to sound recording. Bell's share of the royalties financed the Volta Bureau and the American Association to Promote the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf (since 1956 the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf ). May 8, 1893, was one of Bell's happiest days; his 13-year-old prodigy, Helen Keller, participated in the ground-breaking ceremonies for the new Volta Bureau building--today an international information centre relating to the oral education of the deaf. In 1885 Bell acquired land on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia. There, in surroundings reminiscent of his early years in Scotland, he established a summer home, Beinn Bhreagh, complete with research laboratories. In 1898 Bell succeeded his father-in-law as president of the National Geographic Society. Convinced that geography could be taught through pictures, he sought to promote an understanding of life in distant lands in an age when travel was limited to a privileged few. Again he found the proper hands, Gilbert Grosvenor, his future son-in-law, who transformed a modest pamphlet into a unique educational journal reaching millions throughout the world. As interest in the possibility of flight increased after the turn of the century, he experimented with giant man-carrying kites. Characteristically, Bell again found a group of four willing young enthusiasts to execute his theories. Always an inspiration, Mabel Hubbard Bell, wishing to maintain the stimulating influence of the group, soon founded the Aerial Experiment Association, the first research organization established and endowed by a woman. Deafness was no handicap to the wife of Professor Bell. At Beinn Bhreagh, Bell entered new subjects of investigation, such as sonar detection, solar distillation, the tetrahedron as a structural unit, and hydrofoil craft, one of which weighed more than 10,000 pounds and attained a speed record of 70 miles per hour in 1919. Apart from his lifelong association with the cause of the deaf, Bell never lingered on one project. His research interests centred on basic principles rather than on refinements. The most cursory examination of his many notebooks shows marginal memos and jottings, often totally unrelated to the subject at hand--reminders of questions and ideas he wanted to investigate. It was impossible for him to carry each of his creative ideas through to a practical end. Many of his conceptions are only today seeing fruition; indeed, some undoubtedly have yet to be developed. The range of his inventive genius is represented only in part by the 18 patents granted in his name alone and the 12 he shared with his collaborators. These included 14 for the telephone and telegraph, 4 for the photophone, 1 for the phonograph, 5 for aerial vehicles, 4 for hydroairplanes, and 2 for a selenium cell. Until a few days before his death Bell continued to make entries in his journal. During his last dictation he was reassured with ""Don't hurry,"" to which he replied, ""I have to.""",Neutral,2000

The majority of TW's business is the West market. The East market offers our shippers more flexibility. The two percentages should stand alone and not be combined.

(2) It's been a while since we've done any due diligence focused on retail financial transactions in Canada. We are pretty restricted in that area in the US. As I remember it, the new law and subsequent regulations we unearthed a couple of years ago may impose similar restrictions in Canada. (3) If traders in the US might close one of these transactions with a Canadian counterparty or traders in Canada transacted with a US counterparty, they would not be covered by the services agreement in place between Enron Canada and ENA. Let me know if I can be of any help. Mark T.

To date EDC has been entering into physical transactions only for gas and power under forms that have been developed based upon our wholesale physical contracts, Enron Direct UK's form, and compliance with the local regulatory requirements for retailers. If EDC was to enter into financial transactions, they would tend to be papered under omnibus financial GTCs with EDC (as ISDAs would likely not be marketable). Of course credit would need to be obtained in advance, and the transactions are not booked until the counterparty executes the paper. Please let me know. Peter.",Neutral,2001

Jim Sent: Wednesday, August 01, 2001 10:21 AM We do need a formal plan. We have been working closely together to identify the issues as they develop and propose solutions. Doug has been providing us with the necessary specific market information. We have been successful in communicating that information to the new commissioners and Ercot and seeking resolution. The commission is definitely more responsive to market participants that are articulating the issue, providing specific examples and proposing the solution. Grand-standing is ignored. Those who show up with complaints but cannot point to specifics are virtually ignored. Those who show up and complain, but are not participating in the working groups and the daily Ercot phone calls, board meetings, etc. are ignored. Doug and I met with the Chairman of PUCT and have had subsequent conversations. Thane and I also visited with him. Pat Wood made a phone call to Tom Noel and told him to get the Texas market fixed. (Even though he has bigger things to do in D.C., this is his legacy and he recognizes that if deregulation does not work in Texas, the repercussions could be global.) Chairman Sibley and Chairman Wolens (of the Texas legislature) are also engaged in market developments. We have been working with the State Affairs legislative committee and keeping them apprised. There is an Electric Restructuring Committee hearing scheduled for September 6th or 7th. The forum is expected to be invited testimony only. Those currently listed as invitees are PUCT Commissioners and Ercot's Sam Jones and Tom Noel. The hearing is focused on the pilot and we have an opportunity to provide some probing questions for Wolens to direct to Sam and Tom. Now that Sibley is not a candidate for Lt. Governor, there is more freedom to open up and ask some difficult questions. Thane is in Austin on Friday, but is available by phone. I will be on a plane to Houston at 8:00 a.m. Can we find another time that works for us to meet? Thane is in an Ercot PRS meeting Friday from 9:30 until 3:00.

Thanks, Jean cc: Doug Richard Jean & Thane -- Walking out last night, Kevin Presto indicated that there were games being played in ERCOT with the new market rules and prices in certain markets were not reflective of working markets. Enron needs to use this situation to quickly get our viewpoints up into the PUCT and ERCOT ISO on what is driving these problems and our proposed fixes. If ERCOT goes the way of California - either due to market power or poor market design rules - it will be a bad day for deregulation and for Pat Wood. As important, the new PUCT Commissioners need some help right now in messaging the market. Let's get them to support constructive solutions that will make a real difference. Jean and Thane, I think that we need a FORMAL PLAN on what to do over the next 3 - 6 months to leverage this situation. I would like to discuss this with you on Friday am.

Mr. Sanders, as you now have the privilege of handling our litigation, I am looking for your recommendation on how to staff this from a litigation point of view will someone in your group or the Corp litigation unit do the courtroom work? FYI, Bob Vote helped us on the prior garnishment on EECC filed by Dennis Delewski against CIGSA, did a fine job, and knows the players, and I would be glad to have his help again. Please us know what you would like to do. Randy Pais will work it from within EEOS legal. I have not yet notified Jim Derrick, thinking that either you or Mark might want to. I am quite happy to call him if you like.

In the writ, the court very unambiguously and very plainly commands that EECC is not to pay any debt or deliver any property to CIGSA pending further orders from the court. The writ was issued to enforce an judgment for $1.3 million awarded by the court against CIGSA in favor of Richard P Estrada. EECC is also commanded to appear before the court and list all funds/assets in our possession that might belong to CIGSA, and to disclose what other persons we know ofif any, that might have such funds or assets. The lawyer for Mr. Estrada is the same lawyer who successfully garnished EECC in the past to collect sums owed other CIGSA judgment creditors. Please take this prohibition as applying even to cases where CIGSA might be entitled to the money or the property under our contracts with them, or where the funds or property are in joint venture acounts or custody in the US or Mexico until we have had a chance to review matters in detail and make a more accurate assessment. In the meantime, effective immediately, do not make ANY payments to or on behalf of, or release ANY property to or on behalf of, any CIGSA entity without first obtaining legal department approval. The court may impose penalties for violations of its garnishment order. We will assemble an appropriate litigation team to work onthis matter. Randy Pais will be handling this for EEOS legal. I suggest that Mike Pearson and Mark Brand get the word out to the Project Management and Project Control teams on this matter ASAP. JWVS",Neutral,2001

Sounds like you had a great meeting. Let me know if you need any other info. Thanks. Lynn Sent: Wednesday, July 25, 2001 1:40 PM I attended a meeting with a Shipper yesterday who had questions that I promised to answer when I returned to the office. Three of them are questions for you. 1) In order to use the 8:00 AM cycle for true-ups, since you cannot have a new path on the 8:00 AM, is it possible to put in a zero nom path to use for adjustments in the 8:00 AM? Yes 2) What is considered a new nom when looking at non-on-time noms? For instance, if you have a nom on the on-time and change the ID of upstream/downstream shippers on the 6:00PM, is this considered a new nom which jeopardizes flowing gas rights - especially if it was alternate firm? (what exactly triggers the system to view a change to any info that was in place as a new nom) Key Fields trigger a new path. John will get you the fields. 3) Is there a way, by Contract, to not allow a nom to be put in place if it is outside the contract alternate points (they don't want to be hit with Max Rates if their scheduler noms from a point they shouldn't have)? No, the alternate template is all reciept points and all delivery points Also, they were delighted to hear that you would be willing to possibly come to their office to give an in depth scheduling discussion and may take you up on it. I'll let you know. We will need to meet with you before you go (if you go - may not be necessary or requested). Just let me know if they call you, I am sure I can find SOMEONE to go to Virginia.

Dynegy vs. ComEd at FERC Dynegy filed a complaint at FERC that tries to disallow Firm LD from being used by marketers under the ComEd Network Service. IP claims that is losing $ MM because customers are not paying for Capacity. This will impact our ability to ""go physical"" starting next year. 2. MISO vs. ARTO IP is a member of the ARTO. EPMI continues to try and establish only one RTO in the region. I think this is why Dynegy won't state very clearly that 4 RTOs makes sense. No $ impact, although this decision may impact our ability to ""go physical"" starting next year in Illinois. 3. CTC Bet in ComEd My recollection (talking with Harry K.) is that we pre-sold a CTC roll-off in ComEd that could cost our business around $10 MM if it doesn't happen. Most talk in Illinois is that CTC should end early for big customers, so not sure if this is an issue. 4. Delivery Service Tariff Litigation ComEd and IP have filed to increase their rates on Delivery Service Tariffs (but not on Bundled customers because there is a statutory rate cap). EES told us originally that this could cost as much as $50MM, but current estimates are closer to $10MM for ComEd and $2MM for IP. 5. PPO (Power Purchase Option) Termination ComEd is pushing to end the PPO service. PPO provides a re-sell service to marketers while sharing the Mitigation Factor with customers. It is the service we use to ""deliver"" today in ComEd. IP will probably terminate this service because their stranded costs are expected to end sooner, hence, not a major issue for IP? 6. Relative Size of Current EES Book ComEd = 7.8 MM Mwh (extends through 2010) IP = 1.3 MM Mwh (extends through 2008) Hope this helps. Data will improve with more time. Jim",Neutral,2001

You'll recall that Steve's chart on Northern showed an very close correlation between the calculated arb opportunity and the direction and size of the aggregate customer imbalances, by month. Proving once again that TW is just a little different, that method shows no correlation at all on TW. I agree with Vig's conclusion that we should not use this data in the 637 filing. I tried one alternative reading of the data to see if I could find a correlation. Steve's method evenly weights the value of arb opportunities that occur early and late in a month. Please tell me if you agree, marketing folks, but I think a more logical approach would risk-weight the apparent arb opportunites. In other words, an apparent opportunity to short TW and sell the gas for a $.25/mmbtu profit on the 5th of a month is unlikely to generate arb behavior because a trader has no idea on the 5th what the cash out index will be at the end of the month. In contrast, an opportunity to make $.25 on the 25th of a month, when a trader can calculate pretty closely what the monthly index will be, is basically free money. Using that logic, I ignored any apparent arb opportunites in the first half of the month. I eyeballed the timing and size of the arb opportunites (i.e., there's a $.70-.90 arb opportunity to short TW from the 23d to the end of May, 2000) rather than using Steve's mathematical approach. I still didn't see the kind of correlation I'd expect. The correlation is directionally positive in only 4 out of 12 months, and the size of the imbalances doesn't even make sense in the months that correlate on direction. I give up, and am removing the arb argument from the daily imbalance section of the draft. I'll route that separately. Thanks to Vig, Susan, Lorraine and Richard for hustling on this analysis.

Also, the move yesterday I feel was influenced by news that we were selling our India power plant....this is the 2nd news story related to enron selling assets (Portland General) and reducing workforce (Enron Europe laying off employees). Yesterday there was an article that was released stating that there may be some difficulty getting the India deal to go through....hence...me feeling like this thing was probably going to move back down. Also, the employee survey results I read.....not good...enron employee ""consumer"" confidence is not good. Not to mention the fact that I see many of my peers getting solicited w/ big bucks to work elsewhere and the volatile trading environment (hence $$$$$ for enron) slowly dissapating. Lastly....I can always buy enron stock .....at these price levels...taking 3500 bucks and throwing it in the bank..is probably easy money....I can always take the money market and get back in enron....sure I am forgoing getting in at 28.5 (the strike price) but the difference between that and getting in at lets say 40....is a few thousand dollars....rather forgo that and get back in on a definite uptrend...then risk losing this easy money and have nothing to show.

When CP&L is the Seller and EPMI is the Buyer, the CP&L confirm people have been marking through our Product description which says ""Into Cinergy, Seller's daily Choice"" and putting ""Firm LD"" instead. Now that we are confirming under the EEI Master which defines both of these products, we would request that your people not mark through the description. Do you agree and an you facilitate this?

This is the presentation that the Brattle Group---a consulting group= =20 that Edison has long used on gas issues in California---gave last week to t= he=20 legislative committee investigating wholesale gas prices at the California= =20 Border. The day following this presentation (which was followed by a=20 presentation by the California PUC's FERC lawyer), the committee called El= =20 Paso and Dynegy to respond to Brattle's and the CPUC FERC lawyer's=20 presentations. Also attached is the best synopsis of the hearing that I've= =20 seen in the press. Best, Jeff = Competing evidence clouds Calif. investigation Prompted in part by the California Public Utilities Commission, the=20 California Assembly has been scrutinizing the role that interstate pipelines have played in the= =20 state=01,s current energy crisis. In the efforts to find a smoking gun, legislators have leane= d=20 heavily on a report prepared by The Brattle Group, a consultancy commissioned by utility= =20 Southern California Edison to dig up evidence of market power abuse. But the state=01,s biggest transporter of gas to California -- El Paso Natu= ral=20 Gas -- is not ready to take the rap. The pipeline has commissioned its own study, which i= t=20 recently presented as evidence that it has not circumvented any laws or regulation. As reported in both the trade press and national media, SoCal Ed and the CP= UC=20 are pointing the finger of blame at El Paso for alleged manipulation of California borde= r=20 prices through affiliate deals and capacity hoarding. And exhibit A in their case against = El=20 Paso is The Brattle Group=01,s study of the California market. Richard Zeiger, a spokesman for Assembly Member Darrell Steinberg, chairman= =20 of the California Assembly Judiciary Committee, told Gas Daily that The Brattle=20 Group=01,s market study proved that the surge in gas prices at the California border was not= =20 caused by normal market forces (GD 4/20). His remarks followed an oversight hearing during= =20 which Assembly members questioned Dynegy and El Paso officials about their involvement in= =20 the California market. El Paso presented a different version of events to the Assembly. In a repor= t=20 presented to legislators, a research group hired by El Paso concluded that a convergence= =20 of factors, not a conspiracy, caused the price run-up. Lukens Consulting Group, a Houston-based consultancy, was retained by El Pa= so=20 to conduct work on several fronts. In its study of the California market, Lukens=20 concluded that the increasing convergence of the gas and electricity businesses was one of the= =20 main culprits in the California gas price imbroglio. Assemblyman John Campbell, a Republican member of the oversight committee,= =20 said he ""didn=01,t see any smoking gun"" in either report. ""We had our committee hearing, and we certainly had a lot on the Brattle=20 Study and a little on the Lukens study. To some degree, I=01,m not sure that the California=20 legislature is the best place to adjudicate the differences between these two studies,"" Campbell=20 said. ""I believe FERC is looking at this situation "" and it would seem to me that that=01,s the= =20 appropriate place."" Campbell said that the CPUC had been prodding the California legislature to= =20 give support to its claims of market power abuse by pipelines. ""It=01,s being pushed=20 basically by the Public Utilities Commission here, which believes that there was collusion"" by=20 pipeline companies to push up gas prices in California, he said. The CPUC, Campbell suggested, sought satisfaction before the California=20 assembly when it had failed on the federal level: ""There=01,s a concerted effort, not jus= t on=20 natural gas but on other things here in California, for entities and organizations here to point the= =20 finger elsewhere for the problems that we=01,re having in this state and I think you=01,re seein= g some=20 of that with the public utilities commission."" Whether either report wins over the public incensed by high natural gas=20 prices is a different matter entirely. In the meanwhile, the dueling California market studies se= em=20 to have taken on a life of their own. The Brattle Group Study, for instance, has become the center of a heavily= =20 litigated effort to force FERC to compel the release of market data by California market=20 participants. Following on a request by SoCal Ed, which said it needed additional data to round out= =20 The Brattle Group report, FERC Chief ALJ Curtis Wagner issued subpoenas to the other three=20 major pipelines that serve the state as well as to Sempra Energy Trading. Several parties resisted FERC=01,s call for market information, saying the= =20 requested data contained commercially sensitive information. FERC allowed the discovery=20 process to move forward but only after attaching strict data protection rules restricting= =20 access to evidence (GD 4/23). Critics of the pipeline industry have already suffered one setback in their= =20 case. The commission recently dismissed the CPUC=01,s claim that El Paso rigged the auction of a= =20 large block of pipeline capacity in favor of affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. In=20 addressing the California Assembly, representatives of Dynegy said that FERC=01,s recent ruling on th= e=20 California border controversy obviated the need for more investigation. The controversy, however, is far from over. FERC last month also ordered a= =20 hearing into whether El Paso Natural Gas and its affiliates manipulated capacity to driv= e=20 up the price of gas delivered into California (GD 3/29). That hearing is likely to take place= =20 this summer. (RP00- 241, et al.)

These events include customer and employee meetings, and trade shows. ENA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this memo. The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events. However, the threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to $2,000, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval. Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events. 1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events with anticipated costs in excess of $2,000 must be reviewed by the ENA Public Relations (PR) department and approved by the ENA Office of the Chairman 2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract negotiations for all such events. Once this is completed, the PR department will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program and ENA. 3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting documentation is required for each event. Employee meetings require a detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval. Please submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR department at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the form. 4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the ENA Office of the Chairman for final approval. Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for various local sporting events and concerts. If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.

Kahn went over his previously released SCE sponsored report on withholding. He discounted the Mirant sponsored Hogan report as inconclusive and indicated that he will be releasing a response shortly. Kahn indicated that Tim Belden refuted his report at a meeting in Santa Fe but that Tim would not ""predictably"" release hard copies of his report. Kahn also referenced an Enron document addressing his report contained in an Enron FERC filing. Senator Dunn told his staff to make note of Tim's name and the reports. Senator Dunn indicated that the committee is now in possession of confidential ISO documents. Regarding Pescetti, he called Smutney, Gary Ackerman and I into a meeting. Gary did not show up. Anthony discussed four items he is considering legislatively: 1) Edison deal minus the assets with a rate cap. He is concerned that if SCE goes under the state will implement the PPA through drastic measures. 2) Establishing a 15 month cost-plus rate cap with one condition, the state must build 10,000 mw within the 15 months or the cap will be lifted. 3) Direct access (I told him to talk to Dave Kelley before he does anything) 4) Expedited Path 15 legislation, perhaps with partial generator funding. He expressed interest in real time metering as a means to increase conservation. Smutney suggested using part of the PPA money to install meters for all customers. I told him Enron used these meters with great success for the industrials. Anthony had some concern with reliability so I told him I would get information. I'm working with Elizabeth Linell on this. He also expressed interest in buy-down so I gave him Enron's plan. Anthony said he is working alone on these proposals. Scott",Neutral,2001

I've been working on the upcoming meeting since March, but as you can imagine, the direction has changed several times. We are delighted to have General Norman Schwarzkopf delivering a keynote address on leadership, and Gary Hamel returning to help us process the past year. While we have arranged an all-star line up of outside speakers, we also want to focus on what is happening inside Enron. Rather than having only one or two business presentations, Mark Frevert has opted to moderate a panel to provide a high level overview of each of our primary operating units and has selected each of you to participate. Currently, the panel is scheduled to take place 8:00-9:30am on Friday, November 16. Please plan to present a very high level overview of your business. You are welcome to use PowerPoint slides, but in the interest of time, presentations must be no more than 10 minutes. Mark will introduce each of you, interject questions, encourage interaction, and ensure we stay on time. Below is the proposed order for your presentations. Regardless of your place in the rundown, you will need to be seated on stage by 7:50am and equipped with a microphone.

I've just had two ""need them yesterday"" requests that I need to complete today. Are you available tomorow to discuss further? Best, Jeff Kurt 04/19/2001 01:13 PM cc: Michael Jeff, My name is Kurt Lindahl. I recently joined Enron Global Markets on the LNG team. I'm the Lead Developer for the West Coast and have been charged with building a (several) LNG terminal(s) on the west coast. Michael McGarry, from Enron Engineering and Operational Services Company, is the lead Development Engineer on the project. A key question in this effort is, ""Where is the best entry point into the Socal/SG&E/PG&E pipeline systems. In other words, where can we site a LNG terminal and deliver natural gas into their systems, such that the amount of facilities they require is minimal? I spoke with Ben Asante who heads up the optimization department in ETS. He said that if we could get annual flow diagrams for the California intrastate systems, he could prepare a model in about 2 weeks time. Interstate pipelines have to file Annual Flow Diagrams at FERC, but I'm not sure what Intrastates' are obligated to file with the CPUC? That's where I need your help. This is a hot subject, because the race to site an LNG terminal is intense. Could you please call me at 713 345 5044 (O) or 713 515 2759 so that we can discuss. We want to keep this effort very confidential, so please maintain secrecy. I will also want to talk to you about permitting and state approvals. Regards, Kurt Lindahl",Positive,2001

In Canada we are continuing to submit to the jurisdiction of Canadian courts (on the theory that there are no juries in civil actions and arbitration is rarely used in Canadian contracts generally). As we are presently in the process of revising our UK swap agreement forms, I guess it's time to revisit the issue as it applies to UK agreements. Currently we agree to UK law and the jurisdiction of UK courts (where there are no juries in civil actions). Should this continue to be our policy or should we begin going for arbitration in the UK contracts also?

Yes, it is CA Development III, only it is called Salmon somethingorother llc. I anticipate that the most recent version of the LV Co Gen contract will need to be adapted to the CA form - no E Next Generation or ENA as agent. I believe Dale has been working on some tweaks to the form you last worked on for LV Co Gen, and I assume these tweaks belong in the ""new"" Salmon contract. I will forward you the most current form that I've seen, and Dale can protest if he thinks this is the wrong one to work with. Carlos Sole is the lawyer in Houston who will be herding these cats.

Thanks, Jim Sent: Tuesday, December 11, 2001 10:09 AM Jim: Sorry we have played phone-tag. The couple issues I wanted to talk with you about are 1) the reference in your Dec 4 letter regarding re-enrolling customers for switching to Enron, and 2) the listing of Massachusetts Electric as a creditor in Enron's bankruptcy filing. The pending switches of the 1013 customer accounts were canceled based upon our conversation last week. This does not put them on 'hold' for a later switch, since that is not feasible or appropriate. The customers simply remain on their former rate (Default Service or Standard Offer) until they choose otherwise. When/If Enron wishes to re-initiate a switch for the customers, you would need to send through the appropriate EDI switch transaction as usual. If the customer has not yet chosen another supplier, the switch would be processed. We assume you'd take care of any contract updating that needed to be addressed with the customers, as that is a matter between you and them. Hope that clarifies. Please let me know if questions. Have you been able to identify someone in the financial area that could answer some questions on the calculations of the amounts listed under the creditor section of the bankruptcy filing?

I learned so much when I came down in June to watch your traders. I speak with them all a lot on the phone and I am continually striving to learn more about the power business south of the border. In fact, now that there's potential to come work for you, I'm going to work even harder to learn more about west power trading. Please keep me in mind when the next available real-time position comes up. I would be happy to come work for you as early as the beginning of the new year. Do you know when you will be in the market for another trader? And more importantly, would you be willing to hire a Canadian? I don't suppose there would be a problem getting a green card considering I would just be transfering offices for the same company. Please let me know what you think. Thanks a lot Bill, and I look forward to speaking with you soon. Murray",Positive,2001

The ""protected"" list includes Brian Barth, the person most knowledgable from ECT Securities, Julien Smythe, and the person most knowledgable from Akin, Gump. The list does not include Kevin McConville. I assume that ECT will designate Barth as PMK and that Akin Gump will designate Smythe as PMK, so that we are talking about only two depositions. Trial dates and dispositive motion deadlines have not changed. As a result of the the limited extension of discovery cutoff, plaintiffs want to push Brian back to the week of January 29th or the week of February 5th. They are also making noise about Brian's deposition possibly taking four days. We may want to take the position that Brian will be there for three days and no more. That will ruffle a lot of feathers, and you and I should discuss it. Hennegan has asked if I will represent Akin Gump and, if so, will I accept service. You and I should discuss this also.

The net EUR/$ equity flow is Euro supportive currently mainly due to US buying in Euroland, the same is happening with US investors buying Japan. Net government bond flows are also US$ bearish both with Euroland and with Japan, the latter due to strong signs of Japanese repatriation still. All this backs up what seemed a peculiar weakening of the US$ yesterday.

Alt= hough I did not see the word ""congestion"", the implication of what I read i= s that the generator would pay for his extension cord plus any congestion i= mpacts that it makes on the grid. The implication of the last statement is= that the generator would put the grid back into the condition it was in ""b= ut for"" the new generator. That is great, assuming I did not skim from too= high an altitude. Did I? I also read the thing from the point of view of an issue that I had forgott= en about until recently. That is, if the generator pays for all of this up= grade and ""but for"" stuff, and then ""gives"" it to the utility, are there ta= xes due on the ""gift""? When we developed our project in Pittsburg, CA, PG&= E's initial position was that we owed them for the upgrades AND for the tax= es on the upgrades (about 35 - 40% additional charge), which they turned ov= er to the state and fed. (This is potentially A LOT of money to ""waste"" on= an interconnect, if it is an expensive one.) Working with Enron's tax dep= t (I do not remember specifically with whom), we convinced PG&E that taxes = were probably not due for various reasons, and we mutually agreed to get a = private letter ruling from the IRS confirming. (We also agreed that IF the= taxes were ever due, that we would pay them.) I understand that that IRS = ruling was put in abeyance, pending some sort of law congress was consideri= ng. (I may be making this up here as I go along because Calpine bought the= project from us and I lost track of the various machinations.) The point = of all of this. Is it reasonable in this NOPR process on interconnection t= o address the tax issue? Is it too late? Is it irrelevant to the FERC pro= cess? Does anyone know the status of the law making process? =20 I am concerned about taxes for two reasons. First, many of the opponents t= o the proposed NOPR approach thought that all grid upgrades should be paid = for by the utility and included in rate base. (In other words, ""all gener= ators are good and benefit the ratepayers."") On fundamental grounds they w= ill resist paying for upgrades. If they believe that they will get the ins= ult after injury treatment (pay for upgrades AND for taxes on the upgrades)= , they will resist the NOPR more strenously. (FYI to everyone, Calpine str= ongly resisted paying for upgrades at Pittsburg and somehow got out of it. = And guess what? Now with all of the new plants - ~1200MW added by Calpine= within a 5 mile area of 2500 MW of existing - there are congestion problem= s around all of the projects, just as we forecasted. ISO is now considerin= g adding a new zone and/or charging PG&E and/or the projects for congestion= . Because PG&E did not, and probably never will in our lifetime, add the g= rid upgrades so as to include in ratebase, the projects will be hurt. Beca= use all of this is not forecastable in the context of developing a project = in a timely manner, this outcome, exactly as we had forecasted, is why we s= upported the approach in the proposed NOPR.) Second, perhaps naively, I am= assuming that the tax issue is no different for gas pipeline upgrades than= for electric transmission system upgrades. On a project we are now develo= ping in Roseville, CA, we are faced with significant gas pipeline system up= grades in PG&E's system. Significant grossups for tax impacts of the ""gift= "" are are being discussed as I remember for Pittsburg's electric transmissi= on system upgrades. Since it sounds like the same issue, sure would be nic= e if we could get some appropriate precedence going. Any possibliity of de= aling with the tax issues in this NOPR?

Sent: Wednesday, December 12, 2001 9:34 AM Dec. 12, 01:00 EDT Toronto real estate seen as solid value 15% to 20% increase in equity expected over next 10 years Tony Wong business reporter Worried about what your home will be worth 10 years from now if you buy it today? After deducting inflation, the average Toronto home should be worth anywhere from 15 per cent to 20 per cent more over the next decade, says a study released yesterday. Resale values for a Toronto home should do better than the national average, with a solid - although unspectacular - gain in equity, once inflation is factored in. That conclusion comes from research by real estate analysts Clayton Research Associates Ltd. in conjunction with ReMax Ontario-Atlantic Canada and ReMax of Western Canada. ""Toronto will remain the rock of Gibraltar, showing decent, steady gains over the next decade,"" says Pamela Alexander, chief executive of ReMax Ontario-Atlantic Canada. Given that capital gains on a principal home are not taxable, that means an average gain in equity to the Toronto homeowner of 1.5 to 2 per cent every year over the next decade. That might be nothing to do cartwheels over, but it's a relatively comfortable return considering the meltdown in the equity markets. Across Canada, the average home is expected to increase by about 13 per cent in 10 years. ""I've always said real estate is investment for dummies. You pay your mortgage, have someplace to live and you own a home in 25 years. It's not spectacular stuff, but you do come out ahead,"" says Alexander. That was not the case in the previous decade, however. From 1991 to 2001, home prices increased by only 9 per cent, from an average of $234,313 in 1991, to a forecasted $255,000 by the end of this year. If you factor in inflation, you'd be getting a negative return on your investment. However, Clayton Research says the next decade will be different than the last, primarily because: Demand for home ownership will remain elevated due to the low vacancy rates in Toronto rental accommodation. About half of Canada's international migration is destined for Toronto, which will boost population growth and first-time buyer demand. While the present economic slowdown is taking a toll on the Toronto economy, the medium-term outlook for Toronto is favourable. Canada-wide, the number of households is expected to expand by another 1.5 million over the next 10 years. While homes in Toronto, Ottawa and Kitchener-Waterloo are expected to post gains of 15 per cent to 20 per cent over the next decade, Calgary is forecast to lead the country in terms of appreciating housing values of between 20 per cent and 25 per cent. Clayton Research says the most significant event driving the housing market will continue to be demographic. The post-war generation born between 1946 and 1966 is moving into prime homeownership years. The youngest members of the group are 35 years old and will be 45 in 2011. According to census figures, people older than 45 are about 15 per cent more likely to own a home than people between 35 and 45. They are also set to inherit considerable wealth from their parents, a factor expected to affect their housing choices. On the other end of the market, the 20 to 35 age group is also expected to see a significant upswing, which means more people buying starter homes. Despite the lust we see for condominiums today, the study says that single detached homes will be the most popular dwelling of choice. ""The traditional single detached home will be in strongest demand over the coming decade"" representing 60 per cent of net new households. Condominiums and apartments will still see healthy demand.",Positive,2001

Best, Jeff Sent: Friday, August 31, 2001 5:33 PM Dasovich; Kingerski, Harry; Lawner, Leslie; Susan J Mara; Hedy Govenar; Bev Hansen; Mike Day Carole Migden indicated that they were going to meet again on Tuesday. I followed up with Keith prior to Appropriations and he was very disappointed that he and Bill Leonard could not round up more votes. They knew the liberals would make a play and thought on a policy level they were better off pushing a better bill than allowing a bad bill to go through along party lines. However, Republicans are well aware of the polling and think this issue is better left to the Democrats. Perhaps the liberal play will energize Republican members. As for moving to the left, it did not appear as if Hertzberg was moving left because the amendments seemed to be offered without his consent which is why the hearing was stopped so abruptly. If in fact they are going to stay left and the amendments they presented this morning wind up in the bill, what does Enron think? I have already forwarded the DA amendments to Jeff, Jim and Mike Day. I will send the additional amendments momentarily. Sent: Friday, August 31, 2001 2:52 PM Jeff Dasovich; Kingerski, Harry; Lawner, Leslie; Susan J Mara; Hedy Govenar; Bev Hansen; Mike Day Thanks, Scott. Though the chances of re-kindling a bi-partisan, centrist deal among Rs, Ds and Davis are extremely small. Richmond (Republican leading Assembly efforts) has agreed to stay in touch with Bev over the weekend in the very unlikely event that something rekindles between Rs and Ds. In the meantime, with Davis and the Assembly Ds drifting back to the left, we'll need to redouble our own efforts to make sure we don't lose the ground we've gained. Scott, are they meeting again on Monday, or Tuesday? Best, Jeff Sent: Friday, August 31, 2001 2:57 PM Kingerski, Harry; Lawner, Leslie; Susan J Mara; Hedy Govenar; Bev Hansen; Mike Day The Assembly Appropriations Committee canceled the SBX2 78 hearing mid-way through the presentation by Senator Polanco. As Hedy indicated before, with the Republicans not willing to vote for the bill, liberal Democrats crafted 11 new amendments which they felt were necessary in order to garner their votes. Clearly there was no consensus among committee members or leadership on the amendments in question and the business community was up in arms. Amid the confusion, Hertzberg effectively ordered the hearing canceled. They intend to hear the bill again on Monday.

If Midam does so, Enforcement will then contact Northern for a response--probably Dari or MKM or I, but who knows who they'll call. If they do, the following bullets are important to convey as our preliminary response to MidAm: 1. Midam, and all of our customers, are aware that a Commission order on the June 2, 2000 Settlement is necessary before the precise flow obligation for this Nov-March period can be determined. The flow obligation for sourcers like MidAm will be slightly higher--by about 3%--if the settlement is approved. For all customers that have asked what the precise flow obligation numbers would be under the two scenarios, settlement approval or settlement non-approval, we have given that information. We gave that information to MidAm also. We can't file the tariff sheets setting out the specific number for this heating season until the Commission addresses the settlement. 2. The true financial impact of the current uncertainty on MidAm is minimal. We believe many of the sourcers have locked in their supply based on the lower flow obligation number, but with an option to increase their purchase quantity if the Commission approves the settlement. MidAm may have done that, but we don't know. If not, and if the Commission approves the Settlement, their only real ""cost"" would arise if they have to buy the additional flow obligation volume--about 1100 MMBtu/d for MidAm--now at a higher price than they would have paid if they bought it earlier when they locked up the bulk of their flow obligation supply. Given the large drop in gas prices the last several days, there may not be any increased cost. 3. The bottom line is that we really need an order on the Settlement. The majority of Northern's customers support it as a fair solution to the Carlton problem. MidAm is the only opponent that has raised substantive issues. MidAm is clinging to a financial windfall it gets under the old Carlton mechanism and has no reason to oppose the settlement other than preserving that windfall. That's the end of the proposed script. The last bullet may go to far, but I like it. Frank and Steve, MKM suggested that you guys get Doering and Gorak and others to call FERC (hotline or otherwise--I don't think it matters) and express their concern that the order is not on the agenda.

While Doug was unsure of whether an RTO commitment would be necessary in a future sale of Portland General, Adam Wenner assured Doug that FERC would definately require Portland to make an RTO commitment. In the last attempted merger with Sierra, Portland made a commitment to join an RTO, provided that BPA was also part of that RTO. PGE explained that because its system is so intertwined with BPA, that it realistically could not join an RTO without BPA. FERC found this commitment, with the BPA qualification, to be acceptable. While PGE would probably be willing to make the same RTO commitment that it made last time, the Show Cause Motion goes farther than that. We say in the Show Cause Motion that every entity must make an unqualified commitment to join a FERC approved RTO. It does not provide for exceptions. A couple of things came out of Paul's meeting with Doug. First, Doug asks that we delay filing the Motion for a couple of weeks, to see if anything happens regarding a new sale of PGE. Doug is concerned that if we make a commitment before an agreement is reached, that the existence of the commitment could delay entering into a final sales agreement. Second, we need to decide how to deal with the PGE commitment. It is unlikely that PGE will be willing to commit to RTO participation without BPA. Paul and I discussed that perhaps we could reference in the Show Cause Motion the Federal Power Marketing Agencies and the need for them to join in the RTOs in order for the utilities to make an RTO commitment - perhaps reference Pacific Northwest particularly, although this looks a little transparent. The problem is that many entities will try and use this as an excuse to not join an RTO. Also, Paul and I discussed the ""One Western RTO"" issue and how Enron responds to that. We talked about three possibilities: 1) try to not take a position on the One Western RTO issue -- push for RTO development in the west but try and stay out of the one-versus-two-versus-three RTOs in the West; 2) take a position saying that the west is different, the California mess continues, people are concerned that California will contaminate the rest of the west, so we should create an RTO in the rest of the West and have California join when it gets in line with FERC; 3) support FERC's statements that it wants one RTO in the west and push for this (although most of our people tell us that this will lead to inaction on any western RTO development); or 4) focus on the east and forget about the west. The second option causes me concern because I think that, if we take this position in the West, even though the West is different, our position will be used against us in the East. For example, some people oppose one Northeast RTO because they are concerned that New York (a disfunctional market) will contaminate PJM (a working market). It's a slippery slope for us to try and distinguish the west from the east. If we make contrary arguments in the west, they will be used against us in the east. Your thoughts are appreciated.

Sorry if this email is a bit long. I came across a listing for a position with Enron in NY and am highly interested in applying for it. But, I would like to ask your advice regarding the approach I should take. When I was an undergraduate at Penn (Wharton & CAS), I started my own fertilizer trading company. With zero capital and zero contacts in the industry, I built up a company with $ 15 mil in revenues and clients all over the world. I personally developed relationships with clients like ConAgra, Transammonia, Mitsui and numerous others in Latin America and Europe. Six years ago, outside factors forced me to join my family business, which is in the entertainment industry. Now, I am at a point where I can, and want, to return to what I originally did. The Enron position describes the exact objectives I faced in developing my own company - selling to large commercial and industrial customers. That is exactly what I did and did well. But, I am afraid that if I send my resume to the Human Resource dept. they will overlook my early experience and will be confused why a Broadway producer is applying for the job. Do you happen to have any suggestions ? Perhaps you might know someone in the New York office that I can meet with. I am very interested in working for Enron and know that I posses the right skills. I would greatly appreciate your advice. Thank you, Rina Kirshner",Positive,2001

Most of the grievances were filed between 1999 and 2001 against the plant's previous owner, Sempra Energy (SRE </investments/quotes/?symbol=SRE>, news </investments/news/?symbol=SRE>, msgs </investments/discuss/?symbol=SRE>) unit San Diego Gas & Electric, for which the men continued to work while Duke controlled the plant. But interviews with the three men also revealed a dissatisfaction with Duke's profit-centered management style in the deregulated market. Duke has called the employees' allegations about its operating procedures ""baseless."" Duke has said the employees have an ""ax to grind,"" because they weren't hired by the company in April when escrow on the power plant closed and Duke acquired some of SDG&E's workforce. The men are the first to come forward publicly and testify against their employers, who are locked in a high-stakes struggle with the state of California over allegations of price gouging. The state is pursuing billions of dollars in refunds from power producers and hopes to bring criminal charges against their executives. Glenn Johnson, 52, a mechanic at the South Bay power plant, alone filed 30 complaints. On one occasion, Johnson said he called the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health, because an unqualified employee was found scraping up asbestos. He also has a harassment complaint against SDG&E regarding an employee who now works for Duke, but Johnson said his lawyer told him not to discuss it. Aside from the formal complaints, Johnson said under the Duke regime he was disciplined for taking too much sick time after being out for 10 months for cancer treatment. ""This is just the kind of abuse we had to endure ever since this became a business,"" he said. One of the other employees, Jim Olkjer, 56, a former assistant control room operator at the power plant, filed three complaints against SDG&E while Duke operated the plant, because his evaluations consistently said he needed supervision. The grievances were either turned down or settled, he said. Olkjer said he decided to testify against Duke after he learned he wouldn't be hired by the energy company when it took over plant operations in April. ""I'm on a fixed income now,"" Olkjer said in an interview. ""I can't afford my utility bills on a fixed income."" The third employee, Ed Edwards, 42, a certified power plant mechanic, said he filed one complaint against three SDG&E employees in 1999 for racial discrimination. One of the employees was hired by Duke. That case is still pending. Edwards, an African-American, said Duke didn't hire qualified minority employees after it took over the plant and instead hired less-qualified white employees. Edwards said the two minority supervisors that worked at the plant under SDG&E were replaced with white employees when Duke took over. Edwards, who stopped working at the plant in February, said he decided to testify against Duke after receiving a phone call from Johnson. ""I knew I wouldn't be hired,"" he said. Edwards and Johnson filed charges of harassment and racial discrimination against SDG&E with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. SDG&E spokesman Art Larson wouldn't comment on the allegations. Duke spokesman Tom Williams said the company stands by its hiring practices and ""always hires the most qualified employees."" In 1999, Duke settled a 1996 discrimination claim with the U.S. Department of Labor for $769,700, in which the department found some areas where white females and black males were paid less than white male and black female counterparts in similar positions. Dissatisfaction With New Priorities The former employees said they weren't motivated to blow the whistle on Duke by the prospects of cashing in on a possible settlement with the state. Johnson first alerted the media about Duke's behavior before state Attorney General Bill Lockyer mentioned financial rewards for whistleblowers. The employees each earned about $1,000 a week. All three employees said they believe Duke mismanaged the South Bay power plant by ramping the units up and down, tossing out spare parts, and operating machinery when it was broken. Olkjer said he saw the plant's output reduced during the worst power emergencies ""at least 50 times."" When Edwards questioned his supervisors about the behavior he said they told him, ""It's none of your business."" The employees said that Duke was more concerned with making money than the happiness of its staff, and that the company tried to bust its union contract when it first took over the plant. ""I was paid to twist wrenches,"" Johnson said. ""The last raise I got two years ago was 2.25%. That's an insult to my skill."" Duke said it is bringing the former SDG&E employees under its contract with International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1245. The workers were previously represented by another local, and Duke wanted a single contract. Johnson said he decided to blow the whistle on Duke because he was disgusted by the company's ""gluttony and greed."" He said he stole the control room logs in February after a colleague pointed out to him that Duke was reducing output at the plant. Johnson, Edwards and Olkjer said ""in the old days"" the power plant ran at full throttle and never ramped up or down. But as soon as deregulation became law in the state, things started to change. SDG&E would also vary the plant's output, but not as dramatically as Duke did, they said. ""To the best of my recollection, we had years of being extremely reliable and being on line all the time,"" Edwards said. ""Once Duke took the reins, that changed. We were no longer a family."" Duke has said that it adjusted the plant's output to meet its contractual commitments and to respond to the directions of the California Independent System Operator, manager of the state's power grid. The ISO frequently directed plants to ramp output up and down to meet changing requirements on the grid, and the employees who testified weren't in a position to know the whole picture, said Bill Hall, vice president of Duke's western operations. Duke spokesman Tom Williams said the company plans to release data showing the ISO ordered the plant to ramp up and down Jan. 16-18, the period cited from the control-room logs, to keep supply in balance. A copy of the ISO control-room logs obtained by Dow Jones Newswires shows that the ISO did make such orders during a Stage 3 emergency, because it didn't need Duke's capacity, which it thought too expensive. -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; <Embedded Picture (Metafile)>",Negative,2001

Under the current limits the Central desk can have a position 2,000 Contracts larger than Texas and the East Desk 1,000 Contracts larger. 2) When looking at performance YTD I wonder if higher VAR limits only gives the desks a greater ability to double down to try and make up the YTD losses. VAR LIMITS DESK P/L EAST $10 MILLION ($66.1) MILLION CENTRAL $12 MILLION ($13.9) MILLION TEXAS $8 MILLION $55.8 MILLION 3) It also bothers me that everyone else does not hold the VAR limits in as high regard as Tom & I. There are no consequences if the VAR limit is violated. In fact in days like today you are rewarded for breaking the VAR limit. I feel that the following should be implemented in order to stress the importance of the VAR limit. The P/L for any desk exceeding the VAR Limit by more than $500,000 will be decreased each day by the amount they exceeded the VAR limit. (For example if a desks VAR limit is 10,000,000 and the VAR is $12,000,000 the P/L for the desk would be decreased by $2,000,000. If the situation is not corrected by the next day the same procedure would be followed.) This method I believe makes for an even playing field. Under the current procedures what I'm learning is if you ignore the VAR limits and you are right no one will remember at year end and you are rewarded for breaking the rules. Please give me your thoughts when you have a chance. Thanks, Jim",Negative,2001

Male Maturity When I was 14, I hoped that one day I would have a girlfriend. When I was 16 I got a girlfriend, but there was no passion. So I decided I needed a passionate girl with a zest for life. In college I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional. Everything was an emergency; she was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened suicide. So I decided I needed a girl with stability. When I was 25 I found a very stable girl but she was boring. She was totally predictable and never got excited about anything. Life became so dull that I decided that I needed a girl with some excitement. When I was 28 I found an exciting girl, but I couldn't keep up with her. She rushed from one thing to another, never settling on anything. She did mad impetuous things and made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun initially and very energetic, but directionless. So I decided to find a girl with some real ambition. When I turned 31, I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted firmly on the ground and married her. She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned. Now I am 49 and just looking for a girl with big tits. Internet Email Confidentiality Footer Privileged/Confidential Information may be contained in this message.

Bilas, dissenting: One could say that this order is consistent with the Administration's present third world country mentality. We are punishing the very consumers and providers who made a commitment to ensuring electric restructuring did work by adding a demand retail component to cure the dysfunctions in the wholesale market. We are not convinced that the Department of Water Resources (DWR) bond ratings depend on killing direct access. This notion is a scare tactic and a smoke screen. Direct access comprises such a small percentage of overall demand that it cannot reasonably be seen to be a threat to the sale of the bonds. Direct Access should be seen as a benefit to DWR. It would decrease the amount of the utilities net short obligations and relieve DWR from its power purchasing responsibilities sooner. Something else is going on here. We think that the DWR does not want direct access because if the public is presented with alternatives, it will make DWR's purchasing mistakes abundantly clear. The Commission should be holding hearings to test the assertions being made by DWR, Finance and the Treasurer. Instead, the Commission is making an ill informed, panicked decision to act now and study the repercussions later. DWR and the bonds should not be threatened by direct access if DWR is making prudent energy purchases. Only if DWR's contracts are too expensive, relative to market, will customers seek shelter in lower direct access prices. Indeed, retaining direct access as a way to send price signals to consumers may be the only way to place pressure on DWR to make more prudent purchases. This is a very important consideration since AB 1X prevents us from engaging in any prudency review of the DWR costs to be passed through to ratepayers in order to repay the bonds. If there is no yardstick, how can anyone measure DWR performance? The answer is, one can't, unless SB 18xx is signed into law. We think that additional review of these issues, before suspending direct access, would have produced a more sound decision in the long run. For these reasons we must respectfully dissent. /s/ HENRY M. DUQUE /s/ RICHARD A. BILAS Henry M. Duque Richard A. Bilas Commissioner Commissioner September 20, 2001",Negative,2001

Governor To Address State BYLINE: JENNIFER COLEMAN DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif. BODY: ???While Gov. Gray Davis prepared to speak to the state Thursday night about California's energy crisis, economic forecasters predicted the power crunch would lead to higher taxes and scrapped public projects. ??Davis said Wednesday he hadn't written his five-minute address, but that he planned to discuss ''the progress that we've made and what we have to get through.'' ??Among other things, he was expected to talk about the more than 40 percent rate increases approved last week by the Public Utilities Commission for customers of the state's two largest utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison Co. He has asked California television stations to carry his remarks live. ??California has been hit with rolling blackouts and tight power supplies blamed in part on soaring wholesale electricity costs. ??On Wednesday, the state got more bad economic news: The UCLA Anderson Business Forecast said Californians would face higher taxes and a tighter state budget because of the billions of state dollars being spent on emergency power. The blackouts and the state's scrutiny of private power suppliers also threaten to scare away new businesses, the report said. ??Facing continued refusal from federal energy regulators to cap high energy prices, Davis said Wednesday he would be willing to support a windfall-profits tax on electric generators that have made a fortune selling power to California this year. ??A bill to that effect was introduced Wednesday in the state Assembly. It would tax gross receipts that ''significantly exceed'' the cost of producing power and tax profits of power marketers who have bought power and later sold it at much higher rates. ??''We continue to allow some electricity generators and middlemen to reap enormous profits on their sales of electricity into the state. This profiteering must stop,'' Democratic Assemblywoman Ellen Corbett said. ??Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams said he doubted a tax on a selected industry would be legal. He added that such a tax would discourage generators from building new power plants in California. ??''The governor has made very clear that he is trying to do whatever he can to increase the amount of generation in California and reduce the price. Windfall-profits taxes do neither of these,'' Williams said. ??Davis said he generally opposes treating profitable companies in that manner, ''but these profits are outrageous and are at our expense. The only things companies understand is leverage.'' ??For the first time, Davis also said the state should let companies buy their power from generators instead of going through the utilities. ??The Utility Reform Network and the head of the PUC oppose the idea. They argue residential customers and small businesses unable to contract with generators would get stuck with the bill for the billions of dollars the state has and will spend buying electricity for the customers of the cash-strapped utilities. HEADLINE: 'Chaos' in state electricity planning BYLINE: By Rick Jurgens BODY: ??LOS ANGELES Two hundred of the finest economic minds in California gathered Wednesday at UCLA's Anderson School of Management to discuss the state's energy crisis but, as state Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch spoke, the power to her microphone cut out intermittently and unexpectedly. ??""I don't have any control over this,"" the beleaguered technician operating the sound system called out after repeated outages. ??""I feel your pain,"" Lynch replied with a smile. ??No one in the audience doubted that. After two rounds of rolling blackouts that state officials were powerless to prevent, Lynch last week led the commission to hike retail power rates 42 percent, sparking protests from consumer groups. ??But at UCLA Lynch had power and natural gas producers in her sights. She promised to lead ""a war against the sellers who are taking so much value out of the California economy and not adding a whit of value."" ??Lynch said she favored reinstatement of wholesale price caps that were ended by the Federal Energy Rate Commission in December but wasn't counting on that. ??Even without those caps, she said she was optimistic that the state had enough tools to restrain price hikes by wholesalers and avoid another rate hike. ??Those tools include conservation, purchases of long-term power contracts by the Department of Water Resources, utility cost cutting and making sure the small power producers known as qualifying facilities are online, she said. ??Lynch dismissed the state's 1996 deregulation plan as a ""failed experiment"" and said she did not accept a questioner's premise that ""true deregulation is our goal."" The problem was that ""the state stepped back too much"" from management of the power system and that there had been ""too much ideology and theory and not enough practical solutions,"" she added. ??A panel of experts offered some grim predictions. ""We are expecting severe difficulties for this summer and next summer,"" said Barry Sedlik, a Southern California Edison manager. ??Mark Bernstein, an analyst with the Rand Corp. in Santa Monica, said the electricity problems are spreading. ""This may go on for a while and it's not just California,"" he said. ""In the near term we've got chaos,"" he added. ??But he offered one macabre ray of hope. He said that federal policymakers may feel more urgency to step in if, as now appears possible, rolling blackouts occur in 2002 in Florida where, he didn't need to add, President Bush's brother is governor. ??Problems with the transmission system there, as well as generation shortage, could hurt Florida but the state has enough time to avoid a crisis, he said in an interview.",Negative,2001

The original proposal was for a confidentiality agreement running to the benefit of AEGIS. A subsequent comment from Sara Shackelton, however indicates that a two-way agreement is necessary. As such there are several issues clauses that must be included to address issues unique to underwriting insurance. Specifically (a) confidential information supplied in order to induce AEGIS to underwrite an insurance policy must be warranted (as in any insurance application), (b) AEGIS needs the right to share such information with reinsurers (who can be held to a confidentiality agreement), and (c) if a policy is purchased AEGIS need to retain the information in case there are any enforcement disputes that might turn on the application information. The AEGIS standard confidentiality agreement used in underwriting situations is attached. With regard to the revised draft of June 22nd. I note, in addition to the issues mentioned above, that the governing law provision is somewhat contradictory to the arbitration provisions and that the assumption in section 7 that confidentiality provisions will be incorporated in to the definitive agreement is usually not true for insurance policies.

It has been four years since the first edition was published. During this hiatus, a lot has happened as risk management within the rapidly expanding energy industry has come of age as a respected discipline. The second edition is a rich compilation of papers by a surprisingly representative group of industry leaders, practitioners and academics. The books strength is that it reinforces the fact that risk management principles initially applied to a narrow band of energy commodities can and should be applied across a wide array of energy commodities including electricity. As expected the book does a solid job in capturing an international perspective on the various challenges, which are not isolated to any one continent but are global in scope. It includes a lengthy introduction that effectively frames risk management progress, advancements and innovations that started in the oil markets in the 1970's and migrated to the natural gas and most recently expanding to the electricity industry. Managing Energy Price Risk is comprised of 15 chapters, all of which include an introduction, which minimises the disjointedness that you may expect from a book written by a large number of authors. Other improvements in this second edition include expanded graphics, highlighted panels, detailed appendices and a separate glossary, which provides the reader with additional reference material. In particular the chapter on energy options written by Michael Hampton is a useful primer and provides the reader with a concise explanation of option theory, pricing, basis risk, delta hedging as well as practical guidelines for distinguishing between hedging and pure speculation. For the more advanced reader, the chapter on Energy Exotic Options, written by Vince Kaminski, Stinson Gibner and Krishnarao Pinnamaneni is particularly strong as it outlines the challenges associated with the exotics and effectively documents the latest methods used by leading practitioners in pricing such instruments. Additionally, the chapter on Accounting for Derivative Contracts in the Energy Environment by three consultants from Arthur Anderson, is a well written summary which addresses the numerous tax related issues including a timely discussion on the US Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement 133 (see EPRM October 1999, page 22). Having this tax information housed in one concise chapter is of great value. The second edition however is not without flaws. In particular, it would have been useful to have more information on the current challenges risk managers are confronted with in the power industry including latest advancements in volatility and correlation estimation techniques. Additional attention could have also been placed on the shortcomings of the current market structure and methods in finding and applying appropriate hedging strategies and instruments. In the fledgling power market, this continues to be one of the primary challenges. In summary, this second edition of Managing Energy Price Risk builds upon the sentinel work laid out in the prior edition and is a valuable reference book for the new recruit or seasoned veteran. It is a welcome edition to any risk management library.",Positive,2000

The presents are then handed out to the children at their school Holiday Party in December. For most of these kids, it is their only Christmas present. I am once again coordinating the volunteer / adoption efforts for ETS. Some ETS departments and employees have already sponsored a child-- thanks for your support. But thus far, we have only adopted 216 of 468 children. We need more help!!!! If you would like to participate, I will coordinate collections and adoptions. Simply reply back to this email with the amount you would like to contribute. It costs about $100 to ""sponsor"" each child. Last year we were able to adopt 18 children. All the funds collected will be matched by the Enron Foundation. The matching funds will be used to buy books and computers for the school. I will also need volunteers for shopping.

A followup question: You had told me Friday that the arrival of QF's and other non-utility generators, including plants in neighboring states, had large customers chomping at the bit for competition, but frustrated because the big IOUs still controlled the grid and held the customers captive. But the Yellow book said that already some large customers had found ways to bypass the IOUs and get direct access/retail wheeling. Could you explain? Thanks, Dale.

Several rehearing re= quests were submitted, including one for ENA/EES. However, note the follow= ing which I sent out in an earlier message to the ENA/EES western commercia= l and government affairs folks (I noted you deleted your message without re= ading it.) I consider the tolling of the rehearing order along with this O= MB ruling a good sign. =20 As detailed in the attached FERC notice, the Office of Management and Budge= t (OMB) has approved FERC's Information Collection Request for ""Reporting o= f Natural Gas Sales to the California Market"" through the six-month emergen= cy period that will expire on 1/31/02. (Emergency reporting requirements a= re automatically approved for six months under the OMB regulations.) Howev= er, it gave FERC several conditions that would have to be met before the re= porting requirements could be extended. OMB has advised FERC that, if it decides to request renewal of the Informat= ion Collection Request after that date, it must address certain issues as p= art of its supporting statement (more specifically, ""include an explicit di= scussion""). As you may remember, in addition to requesting rehearing of th= e FERC order, ENA and EES submitted comments to OMB regarding our problems = with FERC's estimate of the burden on affected companies of the proposed co= llection of information. We pointed out that we do not manage our business= in the manner contemplated by the reporting requirements, much less keep o= ur records in that manner. We manage our business on an aggregated basis, = and complying with the requirements will require us to implement significan= t manual review and analysis to arbitrarily define the components of a sale= . We stated that we might even have to hire full-time staff to dedicate to= the task. The issues that we raised in our comments are the same ones that OMB requir= es FERC to address if they submit a request for approval to extend the repo= rting requirements past 1/31/02. (FERC indicated in its July order that it= intended to extend the reporting requirement through 9/30/02 to coincide w= ith the end date of its mitigation plan.) OMB questioned the practical uti= lity of requiring disaggregated data when ""commenters"" reported that they d= id not maintain the data in a way that allowed them to report it that way. = OMB expressed concern that the data collection would require significant d= ata manipulation in order to respond, and the resulting disaggregation woul= d likely be artificial. OMB also required FERC to evaluate its burden esti= mates after ""consulting with respondents"", and it must provide a list of th= e names, affiliates, and phone numbers of the respondents it contacted. FERC has not yet issued an order on our rehearing request. While we would = not expect them to withdraw the reporting requirements entirely, it may be = that the OMB action will affect their final decision. At the least, it sen= ds a signal! << File: IC01-721.00A (OMB).doc >>=20 Sent:=09Tuesday, September 25, 2001 8:58 AM Sent:=09Monday, September 24, 2001 5:45 PM ic; Blair, Lynn; Boatman, Jack; Bradley, Rob; Branney, Theresa; Brennan, Lo= rna; Briggs, Tom; Comnes, Alan; Cordes, Bill; Corman, Shelley; Culwell, Chr= isti; Daniel, Shonnie; Darveaux, Mary; Dietz, Rick; Dornan, Dari; Dushinske= , John; Farrell, Sharon; Fossum, Drew; Fulton, Donna; Goodpasture, John; Ha= mmond, Pearce; Harris, Steven; Hartsoe, Joe; Hass, Glen; Hayes, Robert; Hay= slett, Rod; Heckerman, Bambi; Hess, Theresa; Hill, Robert; Holmes, Bradley;= Holtzman, Staci; Hopkins, Tamara; Horton, Stanley; Huber, Lee; Janousek, M= artha; January, Steven; Kean, Steven J.; Kilmer III, Robert; King Jr., Fraz= ier; Kirk, Steve; Kissner, Tim; Lantefield, Laura; Lawrence, Linda L.; Lich= tenwalter, Blair; Linnell, Elizabeth; Loeffler, Michael; Lokey, Teb; Lowry,= Phil; Mann, Ruth; Mara, Susan; Martens, Donna; McCoppin, Dorothy; McGowan,= Mike W.; Miller, Terri; Nacey, Sheila; Nelson, Kimberly (ETS); Neppl, Ray;= Neubauer, Dave; Neufeld, Eva; Neustaedter, Robert; Nicolay, Christi L.; No= vosel, Sarah; Paladino, Ranelle; Palmer, Maureen; Paschal, Zelda; Patterson= , Geneva; Pavlou, Maria; Petersen, Keith; Place, Janet; Porter, Gregory J.;= Pribble, Dan; Pryor, Tony; Raker, Colleen; Rice, Randy; Ringblom, Kathy; R= obertson, Linda; Saunders, James; Sawyer, Lisa; Scott, Donna; Shafer, John;= Shapiro, Richard; 'Smith, Mike'; Soldano, Louis; Stanton, Lon; Steffes, Ja= mes D.; Sullivan, Kathleen; Talcott, Jim; Taylor, Gina; Tu, Denis; Van Nord= en, Mike; Veatch, Stephen; Vignaroli, Donald; Warner, Jody; Watson, Kimberl= y; Wilkie, Kim; Wilson, Rob; Winckowski, Michele; Wininger, James; Yoho, Li= sa; Atkisson, Margaret; Bianchi, Rita; Bourg, Naomi; Lehn, Terry; Puetz, Fr= ed Does this result in any change to the requirements to comply on 9/30?

Synthetic Storage,matt.smith@enron.com,phillip.allen@enron.com,"Wed, 17 Jan 2001 11:19:00 -0800 (PST)",<5316140.1075844014254.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Phillip, I'm building a sheet for each person specifically for financial hedging. Each day it will pull in the previous days position and previous day price curve to calculate the mark to market. Then that day's transactions can be entered to calculate the P & L of transactions which close out previous positions, as well as to calculate the new open positions. Initially, I thought that daily P&L could be calculated by simply adjusting the P&L whenever a transaction was made by the difference between the bid/offer of the closed out position by the offer/bid of the new position (of course time value and storage costs would be included). However, this only works if the person is 100% hedged, meaning they do not have any open positions which require marking. As the seller of synthetic storage utilizing 100% hedging, I should be able to do this, except for the fact that I will have size limits on transactions that will probably leave me open here and there. The main question I have is simply, ""Should I be calculating the P&L for each person's storage book for open and closed positions?"" Then beyond that, if we do calculate the P&L's from the buyer side, it seems that if their storage is not hedged, I will have to develop the market value of the storage in the ground and the remaining capacity to mark to market it. So, I guess I could apply the model for that purpose. Does this make sense to you? Any comments are appreciated. Thanks. Mat",Neutral,2001

The problem is the combination of restricted stock which is total market value and options which is gain/loss need to be added together to get total portfolio value. I was hoping you could trick the system so portfolio value was accurate. [mailto:IMCEANOTES-+22Emery+2C+20Henry+22+20+3Chenry+2Eemery+40ubspainewebbe Sent: Thursday, June 07, 2001 3:30 PM Mr. Presto, That is true, I was wondering if we shouldn't just figure that the Gain/Loss(Difference between the current market value and the cost basis) represents the actual value of the stock option portfolio. Does that make sense? Thanks, Hank Emery Sent: Thursday, June 07, 2001 2:20 PM The options are not valued properly. The market value is calculated based upon the value of the underlying, which grossly overstates the market value of the portfolio. The restricted stock (basis of $0) is valued OK, but the options are not. In addition, the year restricted stock and option grant is not yet in the portfolio.

Another counterparty, Deutsche Bank, has requested the following which I think is very similar to what we were looking at before: Notwithstanding the foregoing, ""IndemnifiableTax"" also means any Tax imposed by reasons of a Change in Tax Law by a government or taxing authority of a Relevant Jurisdiction of the payer, unless the payee is incorporated, organized, managed and controlled or considered to have its seat in such jurisdiction, or is acting for purposes of this Agreement through a branch or office located in such jurisdiction. In the ISDA Users' guide, they explain that the effect of this language is to eliminate the payee's risk of bearing new taxes imposed by the payer's jurisdiction even if the payee's activities in such jurisdiction is the basis for such taxes. (except if the circumstances in the definition occur). It thus results in the payer having to gross up for such taxes. Do you think that we can or should accept this?

I am following the news and issues about Enron. This has not in anyway change my resolve in working for the company. I am sure the Chairman will stir the company into the right direction. I mentioned to you that I was interviewed two weeks ago by Andy Lewis of the trading group. It was an excellent discussion focusing on similarities in the career path that I and Andy took. Andy reinforced what I read in the Trading Naural Gas book by Fletcher Sturm who happens to be his previous seatmate. More than anything else, it was a great conversation that lasted for one hour and fifteen minutes. He mentioned, however, that he initially found me overqualified. I assured him, nonetheless, that I am committed to the task at hand. The following day, my uncle received a call from someone at Enron who was looking for a number to call me at the university. I surmised this was the second trader who will talk to me as Andy mentioned previously. I left two voice messages at Andy's home and office number. I have yet to receive the second call. I am very much interested in pursuing the application. I will write a separate e-mail to Todd Peikert of HR to check on the status of the program. Just wanted to let you know.

As I mentioned, AWS (originally Automated Weather Source) has more than 5500 weather stations deployed around the US. This is the most dense real-time weather network in the country. We gather data from all of these stations through the Internet, and can feed it out as live data streams. We also have an 8-year historical repository of the data that was gathered as the network was built out. As an example, in the Houstonarea we have 82 weather stations. The National Weather Service has 6. Each of our stations measures windspeed and direction, temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, light, and barometric pressure and 400 of our stations have digital cameras. We can analyze 27 different weather parameters in real-time. Check out Our current products are consumer-oriented. We sell our services to TV broadcast stations, i.e. KPRC in Houston. We also wrap the data in advertising and offer it as the WeatherBug. AWS' WeatherBugproduct is now the largest weather destination in the USas measured by Media Metrics. We are now exploring how our data might be applied to the Energy industry. Examples include offering real-time weather data to energy trading operations which shows in real-time the deviation from forecast. This can be at the national, regional, metropolitan or local levels. You could watch a weather front move into a metropolitan area and see how it is shaping up as compared to the forecast to aid in energy purchases, bids, etc. The data could be used with basis risk in derivative contracts. It could also be used to forecast what a specific NWS station was going to forecast in the near future. You may have more uses. Most of our sites are located in and around metropolitan areas which is a positive for energy demand. We would like to talk with the folks running Enron's trading area to discuss if this data could be used and what products might be built for the industry.

Lynn Sent: Monday, October 08, 2001 6:14 PM All: As part of the TW Negotiated Rate Settlement Hearing, it has been suggested that the following modification to CAS and other associated systems be made: EBB sytem that allows a shipper interested in capacity to simply enter a receipt and delivery point; the system will automatically let the interested shipper know how much, if any, capacity is available (advantage: although it doesn't provide the IS's the ""last look"" auction their looking for, it at least provides an open process for anybody that is interested to find out if capacity is available (eliminates any claim of ""tortious process""); disadvantage: feasibility and cost are unknown at this time). This was drafted by an attorney without considerable consultation with Gas Logistics. A settlement offer that includes minor tariff changes will be provided to the parties in the proceeding this week. Although this will buy some time, a scope and cost estimate needs to be determined so that if the modification above is offered, we know what the cost is.

Jim Sent: Wednesday, August 29, 2001 1:28 PM Hello SE RTO folks I know you all have a ton and half things going on - but I would like for you to look over the attached proposal that will be a waiver for existing control areas to assign certain control area functions over to a central RTO operator. This waiver was originally intended for Grid South but since has expanded to include Alliance, SPP, MISO. The purpose of the waiver is to allow for the continued existence of individual utility based control areas within an RTO AND to fulfill the FERC Order 2000 requirement that the RTO to implement Interchange Schedules. This may become a direct conflict with our position for consolidation of control areas. If you don't read anything else, I advise you to at least read - Sec 2.2 Rationale - 5 brief paragraphs which outlines what the RTOs want to do. Since I am chairman of the NERC Subcommittee that oversees Policy 3, Enron is associated with facilitating this process. I want those working at the settlement conferences to be aware that this is coming. Grid South's original intent was to change sections of Policy 3 to fit their new RTO structure. I successfully argued against doing this on the basis that NERC policy should not prescribe the Grid South scheduling process and control area structure as reliability policy - hence the waiver.

Tomorrow we will have the date set for such a meeting. We are checking travel schedules for Laura Luce and Max Y. to see if we can catch both in Houston sometime next week.

I've been trying to get in touch with you by phone and as I realize you must be in all day meetings I thought I'd switch to email. In your message last time you asked me to get in touch with you this last Wednesday when you would have the outcome of Joe Dilg's review of the ECI contract and my employment contract (at least that's what I thought I understood but the message was breaking down). As I have been postponing a deal I need to close for as long as I possibly can I really would appreciate it if you could provide me with the name of someone at Enron, in case you are swamped with other issues, with the authority to make the payments. As I mentioned before, the payments were due a few months ago and I'm now in real danger of not being able to close the deal at all if the payment is delayed further. ESA is telling me I need to talk to Houston but I did not want to call Ken Lay's office at a time like this. Please send me an email and also if you get some time please drop me a line to catch up on the personal side. I've been busy setting up my business in London and I think I should be ready to go with a couple of new ventures by the end of November. Best regards, Diomedes.",Neutral,2001

I've take a stab at setting up the discounted cash flow model. All my stuff is highlighted in yellow. It's the capex that's screwy (see assumptions given in questions). I get at 25% of 1995 revs, not 45.8% as indicated in the assumptions. I also assume that when it sez working capital is net zero, we don't factor those balance sheet line items into the DCF model.

Mat Tom 02/27/2001 10:00 AM cc: Hi Matt, Multiple values for parameters - sounds OK. I'd add an extra run option to the menu bar, and you could set up a list of parameters on a separate tab, each line corresponding to a complete run. How about a meeting tomorrow when you could tell me what parameters need to be varied? Tom Matt 02/26/2001 05:46 PM cc: Tom, I took a few days off and just got back.... Anyway, I haven't tried it without the key, but if you say it works, then I'm sure it does. One thing I'm realizing, though, is that it's taking me way too much time to babysit this thing through multiple runs of the model even when it does work. In order to get the full benefit of your model I want to run it a zillion times for many different combinations of parameters. So, if you haven't guessed already, I'm wondering how hard it would be to get this thing to zip through some preset combinations of parameters and save the results without me tending to it. I envision a spreadsheet where I list out all of the parameter values for each run, and the model picks out the parameters, runs through a year's worth of data, and saves the summary sheet, then steps to the next set of variables. In this way I could set it to run a bunch of times over night or something so it wouldn't tie up the work day. Would this be just a separate macro? What do you think? Mat Tom 02/22/2001 08:01 AM cc: Hi Mat, I took away your licence key from the back of your PC yesterday. The problems with our network licence for the solver have gone away - I do not really understand what happened. Try the model aand see if it works OK - runs fine on my computer now, whereas it did not run 2 weeks ago. I suspect some sort of network problem, and IT have not been able to figure out any more likely cause. Tom",Neutral,2001

But this is not only information for the new guys a reminder for the old that attention to detail is an important part of the job. Thanks. 1. Purchases made under one book must be sold under the same book. Pay attention when extending deals. If you don't purchase the energy in a particular book, you don't have energy to sell from that book. 2. Specify EPEC as the group when entering deals for El Paso. Also, pay attention to detail with EPE spinning reserves (as a violation is extremely expensive for EPE), also curtail units in the right order. Copper then Newman 4 then Four Corners (Be sure to curtail Four Corners before selling under cost!) 3. El Paso model must tie out with CARP when trading day is done. Check spreadsheet formulas. 4. El Paso totals should be logged in the reconciliation model (m://electric/epe/epe01/aug01/epe reconciliation model) and all variances explained. 5. Bloomberg deals need to be assigned a $15 FLAT broker fee per trade. If you begin a deal with Bloomberg trades, enter a per-megawatt fee, and extend the deal later with bilateral trades, you're effectively charging yourself extra brokerage because THAT FEE WILL BE ASSIGNED TO EVERY MW IN YOUR DEAL.

I've double-checked the deals in EnPower with what I see in the Real Time spreadsheets, and everything seems to match up. I'm attaching those sheets so we can ensure we're all looking at the same thing.

Also, do we want a ""reasoned opinion"" or just a ""decision"" from them? Since there are few, if any grounds for an appeal, McDade recommends a ""decision"". Ileana Ileana, As of now, my calendar is clear for August 20th. I will pencil this in, although I think we should make sure that everybody also has the 21st open in case the arbitration takes more than one day. We will, of course, need to have Max Yzaguirre available. Even though we are posturing the case as a summary judgment case, I think it would also be helpful to have Dwight Beach and Steve Irwin available. They would be the two best witnesses, I think, to discuss all of the things that McKenna had not done in order to have a viable project. I believe this type of testimony would be helpful to the arbitrators so that they would know that, in ruling on the contract interpretation as a matter of law, they are also ruling in a fundamentally fair manner--neither the law nor equity is on McKenna's side. If you agree, I will contact them about their availability. I agree that we should despose McKenna fairly quickly. We will need to nail down what he might say as to contacts with offtakers, etc., so that we can determine the necessity of getting them involved. If we do need to get them involved, perhaps we could do so by way of affidavit rather than live testimony, or, at most, by deposition. Let me know what you think. Thanks.

You do know that Networks and our Broadband businesses are different, I trust. If you have and questions, please let me know, and I'll be happy to help you get to the next group that most interests you. Jeff Massimo 10/12/2000 10:41 AM cc: Jeff, Thank you for giving me the opportunity to work on the Gas Trading Floor. I believe I have learned a great deal not only about the technical aspects of the business but also about the less tangible but as important sides of Gas Trading such as teamwork, open communication, and freedom of thought. In all honesty, the overall environment and rhythm of the floor are the things I have enjoyed most and I can now better understand how these elements have been successfully applied to new ventures. I will be due for rotation in about 2 months and have started to attend brownbag lunches hosted by the various ENRON divisions. The one I enjoyed most was given by the ENRON Networks' E-Commerce group and its relationship with the Houston Technology Center. This group was initially signalled to me by an associate friend of mine working there as an ENRON loaned executive who is also due for rotation in December. From what I gathered, the group's goal to bring together entrepreneurs, new technologies, and venture capitalists could be a good match with my skills and interests. I recall you mentioning Networks to me as a possible rotation and would be very grateful if I could benefit from your feedback and advice on the matter. I thank you again for your assistance and hope all is well in Global Markets. Massimo",Positive,2000

This is complex to say the least and it would involve using the ship differently than scheduled and diverting some of the Oman LNG to other markets with their approval.

Global Personality Inventory (GPI) description: The GPI is a leadership personality inventory based on data collected and developed by a team of industrial/organizational psychologists from around the world. The GPI measures personality for the work context in general and for professional for the work context and contains 37 distinct scales that can be combined to form dimensions relevant to most job models. Japan norms: Japanese mid-level, front-line manager, and individual contributor norms available. b. Advanced Progressive Matrices (Ravens) description: This nonveral test is the same as that used by Enron Australia through Coyne-Didsbury/PDI, and correlates highly with other tests of problem solving capacity. Global PDI manager/executive norms available. c. Leadership Inventory-plus description: a PDI-structured tool used in the selection of entry and mid-level managers, measuring those basic abilities, traits, values, interests, and motivations that are critical to effective leadership. The LI+ includes both personality and cognitive ability (i.e., numerical, analytical, and verbal reasoning) components. U.S. manager norms available. The intention is to use the testing on local hires (not US nationals) to confirm/expand on information gained in the interviewing process. Reference checking is a very poor substitute for interviews accompanied by some objective abilities testing against standard norms. The important thing is that we don't use this information as a be all and end all test of whether we take on a candidate or not. The bottom line is in my professional opinion these tests are an important part of a high quality recruiting effort (and have been demonstrated as such in Australia on several occasions); unless there are significant legal impediments I want to proceed with them. Thanks cc: Alan Michelle Phil- I have raised the issue of testing with Michelle Cash, an ENA labor lawyer, whose comments and queries are set forth below, for your review. Please reply to Michelle's specific queries in paragraph 3 of her e-mail. Paul- Following your review of the attached e-mail traffic, please provide us with the Japanese legal perspective on undertaking these types of activities. Also, based on your experience, inform us as to how testing of this nature may be perceived in the Japanese market. Best regards, John ----- Forwarded by John Viverito/Corp/Enron on 05/12/2000 11:13 AM ----- Michelle 05/12/2000 10:59 AM cc: Alan John, Thanks for including me on the distribution of this -- I received your voice mail and was glad to be in the loop. In general, we try to avoid any type of personality/psych testing because of issues relating to the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits pre-employment medical testing. It does apply to US citizens working for Enron in foreign locations (i.e. extraterritorially). Before we go forward and do this type of testing, it is useful to ascertain the purpose/goal of the tests. Why do they want this information? Is there another, less intrusive, way to obtain that information (e.g., references from prior employers, etc.)? As noted below, there may be Japanese labor/employment law issues that address this type of activity as well. I suggest that we obtain the information above as well as the opinion requested below and then determine how to proceed. Michelle John 05/11/2000 02:44 PM cc: Alan Michelle- Pursuant to my voicemail, I am forwarding the attached e-mail traffic for your consideration. I am unsure as to the types of testing contemplated, but want to ensure that such activities are permitted under Enron's policy. Your comments on the attached agreement would also be appreciated.

The outcome of the testing is a confidential report that comes to me (as HR) and I then send to the participant(s) in the recruitment decision making process for their confidential consumption. PDI have agreed to me doing this via email, however are seeking some reassurance as to our use of and maintenance of confidentiality of the final product. Can you review the attached and come back to me with your thoughts?

FW: Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call,f..brawner@enron.com,a..martin@enron.com,"Mon, 12 Nov 2001 09:25:26 -0800 (PST)",<15371348.1075862316723.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Sent: Monday, November 12, 2001 10:37 AM Sent: Monday, November 12, 2001 10:25 AM Listened in on the analyst call this morning. Here are my notes. Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order. The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements. Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds. Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call. Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them. Specific points: EES will be a part of the new company. Enron assets will be revalued at closing. The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred. If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration. If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred. Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%. Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative. ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity. Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage. In what was termed a ""new approach"", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings. Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true. Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM. Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'. All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks. Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure. Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way. Lay: had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs. Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there. Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash. Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing. Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing. With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible. However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash. ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks. BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies. McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks. Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing. EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there. The big integration effort will be ENA. Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets. Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model. They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that. Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies. Says that their approach evidenced a willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger. Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses. Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing. McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements. ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list. The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron. Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday. Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities. McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized. Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates. Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies. Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity. Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash. ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed). Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices. ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'. (No further clarification given). Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner. They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination. They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained. Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions. He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.' Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today. Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player. He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well. Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments. Patrick Tucker x3-3055",Neutral,2001

I am especially proud of the accomplishments of Energy Operations in supporting this growth. I wanted to express my appreciation for all the hard work and dedication that you have demonstrated. We have done great work and I want to recognize you for that. Although we have done much, we have additional goals to accomplish within ENA and Energy Operations this year. Therefore, as we go forward, I want to make sure that you have all the necessary tools to do the best possible job, and that any barriers that may impede your work are removed. To help in this effort, I have asked a consulting organization -- S.J. Bashen Corporation -- to survey our organization; to ""take its pulse"" if you will; to help us understand what in our environment fosters success and where we could improve; in essence, to assist us in acquiring the ""necessary tools"" and breaking down any ""barriers."" SJBC is comprised of seasoned consultants who assist organizations like ours to help on issues like this. SJBC will meet with members of our group in a private setting where we can highlight our successes, discuss our concerns, ask our questions, make our comments, and the like. This collective information then is studied by SJBC with the goal of providing us an opinion regarding our strengths and weaknesses. Specific input will not be identified by the individual who provided that input. Many of you will be receiving a phone call in the near future from a SJBC consultant. Please schedule a time to participate at your earliest opportunity, as this effort will be a success for our group only if we cooperate to the fullest extent. Of course, given the size of our group, it will not be possible to meet with each of you. Therefore, if you have not received a call from SJBC by August 15 but would like to share your thoughts with them, please feel free to contact Cheryl Brown at 713.780.8056 and Cheryl will be glad to include you in our survey. Communication is one of Enron's core values. I want to stress that only through open communication will this survey be a success. Please be candid. Thank you. Sally",Positive,2000

The conference will be held in St. Louis, MO March 19-21, 2002. Website is Primary attendees are electric power plant developers, builders, operators, and equipment suppliers. One of our proposed speaking topics is ""LNG - a new role in North American supply."" A concern among power generators has been the lack of domestic gas supply and pipeline infrastructure to serve growing gas-fired electric generation needs. The Committee feels LNG can and will play a more a prominent supply role in the near future. I'm looking for an LNG expert who would be willing to give a 15-30 minute presentation on the morning of March 20, 2002, 10 - 11:30am. They would be speaking with 2-3 other presenters and then participate in a Q&A session afterward. After you visit the website, if could let me know if you are interested in speaking, I will have a formal invitation forwarded to you. Thanks for the help!

I've been meaning to call you for several days - but it's been a bit of a madhouse, so I thought I might fire off an e-mail: I don't know if you've talked with Cindy in the past few days - but, if it's okay with you, I'd like to decline your very sweet offer of having a baby shower. Here's the deal: A couple of friends had already offered to do one - and I'm having trouble coming up with a vibrant mix of people to split amongst two showers. This seems to be a good decision for Cindy, too, since may be a bit short of cash and energy right now. However, I would LOVE for you to come to the one shower - if it's convenient for you. I would love for you to meet my friends, and for them to meet you! If it doesn't work for you, I'll certainly understand - especially since you may want to come again when baby is born. But, if you'd like to consider coming, I'd like to know your schedule. We're talking about a weekend lunch or afternoon thing I think. In January or February, I""m available on the following weekends: Jan. 20 Jan. 27 Feb. 17 Feb. 24. I think going any later than this might be cutting it close!

There at the California Power Exchange, where much of the state's electricity is bought and sold, prices that utilities paid for power (an average $166 per megawatt) were up fivefold from the previous August ($32). What is happening? Among other things, too much power on hot days is being purchased in the near-panic environment that develops in the hours before a possible crisis. Too little is being purchased as it should be -- days, or even months, in advance. How was this new market-based system of buying electricity supposed to work? Much of the action was supposed to take place at the Power Exchange. There vibrant trading was supposed to exist in a variety of markets. Some utilities would be busy shopping for electricity the next day. Others, depending on their needs, would be squirreling away supply a month, even a year, in advance. Selling this power are private companies that have been busy purchasing fossil-fuel burning generators from the state's investor-owned utilities. Under the state's restructuring of electricity, these utilities were obligated to sell their fossil-fuel burning plants, but not necessarily their nuclear or hydroelectric generators. On any given day, up to 95 percent of the power needed to fuel California was supposed to be already purchased. The idea was to leave just a little bit for the last minute. Headquartered in Folsom, the state's entire grid is managed by an agency known as the Independent System Operator. The ISO's job is to buy whatever extra power is necessary to keep the lights on. With literally only hours to work with, the ISO is ill-suited to drive hard bargains. The ISO pays up to $250 per megawatt. The problem is that the ISO's spot market is way too big, and too pricey. It is buying up to 30 percent of California's power on some days, particularly hot ones. This August, less power is being purchased in those struggling futures market down in Pasadena. More was being bought in Folsom. This is a telltale sign that California's electricity market is working for those who own power plants, not those who pay the bills that are poised to rise.",Negative,2000

Don't disagree with your thoughts. Let's get the answer that works for the business for the long-term. Jim Sent: Wednesday, October 10, 2001 2:53 PM Trust me, I believe a single energy price is best for the market. But I still don't get why our espousing the platitudes of spot market pricing automatically make it right. I think a theoretically sound argument can be made around separate energy and capacity pricing where the capacity price is more stable but over time achieves exactly the same result for generators as a spot price would. But we do nothing to refute this other model other than call on Thor to curse the icap gods. Admittedly, part of my reaction is my own ignorance of our needs and history but I wonder how much of our view is religion and how much is commercially motivated, especially when at least from the retail view there are solutions which preserve some semblance of ""icap"" but yet make it workable for retail competition. Sent: Wednesday, October 10, 2001 1:13 PM Fine. I still think that any obligation is a mistake. Just improving a bad market is not going to help. Make sure that Dan Allegretti is in the loop. NEPOOL is putting something like this together. Jim Sent: Monday, October 08, 2001 9:59 PM I know. Anyway, the single most important issue from the perspective of Retail seems to be ""daily granularity"". We need to be able to adjust our daily obligation based on customer switching patterns. These can occur at any time. So any thing that locks in our capacity requirement for a long period of time (months to a year or more) can be a killer. A specific model we discussed was ""operating capacity"". This takes the operating reserves concept and blows it up to a full capacity market equivalent. ISO administers the market. Generators commit capacity to energy market or reserve market, but not both. Long term deals possible as well as real time market. Lots has to be flushed out but it seems like a viable approach. Will discuss more on Wednesday. Have talked briefly with Luiz about this. Sent: Sunday, October 07, 2001 1:08 PM Harry -- Enron can never take the position that ICAP is good! I don't know why Stoness is trying to undertake more analysis. His reasoning that ICAP is ""complicated"" and we do well at complications is crazy given the EES business model - Enron Direct. Let me know how it is going. Jim Sent: Fri 10/5/2001 9:00 AM [Kingerski, Harry] We can meet today at 2 pm in room 4746 to discuss more about Retail's view of ICAP and related issues. Scott Stoness' summary of our meeting yesterday with Dale Furrow, his regional leads, and Narsimha Misra: The gist of the meetings was: 1) Pro ICAP was: Pragmatically, high energy costs are bad because they delay competition. ICAP is therefore good because it reduces the high price periods with market intervention. Pragmatically, ICAP is complicated, and complicated translucent rules favor the bright (Enron). Mathematically, 2 separate markets - Capacity and Energy - should result in the same outcome. ie. Energy costs should reduce to exactly offset the increase in demand charges. Theorectically, if the market expects the government to intervene in the event of high power costs, suppliers will build less capacity than needed. Given that this is inevitable (government intervention), we might as well intervene now as later. Theorectically, market failure is probable because small customers are not able to internalize the costs of not hedging, causing them to take more risk than they should. Given that the customers are not making the right societal decision, we should make it for them 2) Pro Not ICAP was: Any artificial price determination will distort the market causing inefficiencies. ie. a fixed ICAP for 12 months will favor a technology available all year round. ie2. ICAP could cause environmental damage by causing CT's to be built instead of Combined Cycle. ICAP, with market, is complicated which will decrease market efficiencies Market prices, with financial firm obligations, will result in a continuous balance of supply and demand Market prices, will result in much more efficiency because they cause more demand side response. Conclusion: There was no consensus. There seemed to be more people on the no ICAP side than the ICAP side. Basically comes down to i) economics suggests ICAP is inefficient, vs ii) lack of ICAP will damage competition. We agreed that if ICAP is inevitable, we should advocate, market determined ICAP's We agreed that, given that this issue is controversial, and that Narshima has the largest interests. He should head up our response. Scott",Neutral,2001

I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.

Larsen"" To: eteor.com> cc: Larsen 02/19/01 05:26 PM Please respond to brent.larsen Hi Stan: It was good to meet you this morning. I've enjoyed working out with Joel; he's a good ""kid"" and I can certainly relate to his Midwest roots and Iowa State background. I grew up on a grain/livestock farm in Gladbrook, Iowa, a town of under 1,000 people, and did my BS at Iowa State and MBA at Kansas University. I'm currently working as Director, Business Development at RedMeteor.com, an internet-based energy brokerage company. We compete against Altra Energy, EnronOnline, InterContinentalExchange and HoustonStreet. We started with $22 million in venture capital, but need an additional infusion of capital to build out our business model. I think it's going to be difficult for us to attract additional funding in this climate, so I'm interested in making a move to another employer when I find the right fit. As I mentioned this morning, I've been talking with Conoco recently (my previous employer for 9 years) as well as Enron's Broadband Services group. I'm looking for a Houston-based business development position that would build on my eCommerce experience at RedMeteor or my oil & gas pipeline operations background. I've also met with Reliant Energy recently although I understand they've suspended hiring in their trading/eCommerce groups due to the California crisis. Any suggestions you would have would be appreciated. Thanks for your time. Brent Larsen W: 281/243-6527 C: 832/724-7666 (See attached file: B Larsen 2-16-01.doc) - B Larsen 2-16-01.doc",Neutral,2001

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES (This article was originally published earlier Friday.) LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Department of Water Resources, the agency purchasing a bulk of the state's power needs in lieu of the three investor-owned utilities, is expected to tell state regulators Friday that they need to increase electricity rates by as much as 25%. This is because there are insufficient funds in the current revenue stream to cover a $13.4 billion bond sale, three commissioners with the Public Utilities Commission told Dow Jones Newswires late Thursday. PUC President Loretta Lynch is expected to issue a draft decision Friday either endorsing the rate hike request or calling for an audit of the DWR's current revenue stream before she makes a decision, aides in her office said. If the PUC determines that there are not enough funds in the current rate structure to cover the bond sale, it will have no choice but to order the rate increase, according to the legislation that put the state in the power buying business. Businesses are expected to bear most of the burden of the rate increase, the second in just two months, if approved by the PUC, the commissioners said. ""Back in May when we ordered the first rate increase, we said we may be forced to do it again by the summer,"" one commissioner said. ""It's unfortunate, but it shouldn't be a shock to anyone. The state has made an enormous commitment to Wall Street that rates would go up whenever it's needed to ensure there is enough money to pay off those bonds."" Lynch and a spokesman for the DWR were unavailable for comment late Thursday. Separately, Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, has drafted a proposal expected to be introduced into the Assembly Friday or Saturday that would have large businesses using the most electricity to finance the bulk of the $43 billion in long-term power supply contracts, aides in his office said. Moreover, Keeley's plan is aimed at reducing rates for consumers who use the least amount of power. Details of the plan are still sketchy, aides said. Possible Rate Hike To Generate $2.5B Yearly For State The 50% rate increase ordered in May is expected to generate $5 billion annually, and if the PUC orders a 25% increase, that is expected to generate $2.5 billion. However, it is still unclear if that is enough, the commissioners said. Businesses are expected to bear most of the burden of the rate increase, the second in four months, if approved by the PUC, the three commissioners said. Since January, the state has spent nearly $8.5 billion buying electricity on behalf of customers of Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric and PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric. The state has borrowed more than $7 billion from its general fund, which must be repaid by ratepayers at 6% interest, to purchase power. In addition, the state has locked itself into $43 billion in long-term power supply contracts at high prices for as much as 20 years to ensure there is enough power to meet demand. Future rate increases to finance the contracts are likely, state officials have said. But if the PUC orders another rate increase, the money won't benefit the utilities, which have billions of dollars in power costs to recover. Instead, it will be used to guarantee Wall Street financial institutions that there is sufficient funds in the rate structure to allow $13.4 billion in revenue bonds to be sold. The bonds are expected to be sold in August or September, said state Treasurer Phil Angelides. The commissioners said the PUC and the DWR waited to address another rate hike to see if state officials and generators were successful in coming to terms on $8.9 billion the state says it was overcharged for power since last year. After two weeks of hearings between generators and a delegation of California utility executives and energy officials, talks broke down Monday. Generators offered the state $716 million in refunds, but Gov. Gray Davis balked, threatening to sue to recover the full $8.9 billion. Any refunds would have been disbursed to the utilities and the DWR, which could have deferred the need for any rate increase, according to Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Davis. An administrative law judge with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said Thursday he will recommend that the commission not order cash refunds to California because the state's utilities owe far more money to the generators than what he thinks the state is owed. -By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;",Negative,2001

The level of detail was on target. Let me know when you want to discuss comp issues. on 04/29/2001 12:23:55 PM cc: 1. Aura. - Received revised bid from UBS which Metts describes as ""real."" UBS will now commence detailed 6-8 week due diligence on EWC (at Enron's expense if deal busts). Confidence re: UBS' ability to execute remains mixed. - LJM (Fastow) interest continues, but unclear how parallel process can be run. Umanoff concerned about conflict when management assists seller as part of UBS deal but assists buyer as part of LJM deal. - Now that '01 numbers scrubbed, in process of revising '02 financial projections based on detailed internal review (as of December, 2000, '02 EBITDA projected at approximately $115mm; up from 1CE '01 projection of $78mm). This is unrealistic; I expect 2002 EBITDA in the $90-95mm range, showing solid 15-20% EBITDA growth. 2. M&A Activity. - acquisition of assets of bankrupt Dutch blade manufacturer, Aerpac, continues; we have closed on several assets and expect final closing in May. - sale of Greek operating projects to German buyer continues, but execution uncertain. Closing targeted for June 30. Sale of Greek development company also launched, with 2 parties expressing interest. 3. 2001 Commercial Activity. - US backlog remains firm. Projected demand continues to exceed our projected turbine supply. Key execution issue is confimation of suitability of 1.5 MW turbine (primarily its gearbox) in more rigorous US wind regimes. - American Electric Power has provided indicative bid to purchase the two Texas projects we have under development (Indian Mesa I and Clear Sky); indicative bid price is attractive. AEP has requested Enron Corp guaranty of EWC's turbine warranty, like they have received on previous sales with EWC. Enron Corp guaranty is approved internally, but, in light of Aura, we will continue to bargain for no Enron Corp credit support. Finally, debt financing expected to close on IMI in May and debt circled on Clear Sky in June. Turbine suitability due diligence is key pacing item for debt closing. - European backlog remains firm, expect for Spanish sales of 750kw turbine, which remains soft. EWC attended Hannover Fair last week, the largest industrial trade show in Europe. Our exhibit was very well received. CEO of German competitor, Enercon, approached Umanoff to discuss IP issues (Enercon is currently barred from US market on patent infringement grounds). 4. HR Issues. - US has lost O&M director and 2 key commercial employees have expressed concerns. Need to finalize retention program (Umanoff to discuss with Horton early in week). - Key recruiting initiatives are: GM Spain; head of global procurement/blade MFG; European GC. Umanoff would also like to re-visit hiring US GM/MD, as day-to-day US operations require more detailed oversight than Umanoff is currently providing; not clear if we can recruit for this position in the midst of Aura. Stan - for the future, please let me know whether this is the right level of focus. Talk with you soon. Adam",Positive,2001

Thanks. ----- Forwarded by Gerald Nemec/HOU/ECT on 10/25/2000 10:48 AM ----- Colleen Sullivan 10/24/2000 01:25 PM cc: One of the trading desks is ready to support a new product on EOL for transportation capacity. This should be a very simple product. At this point we don't need anything to feed back from EOL to Sitara at all. The product can easily be added on the current gas screen with no new fields at all on the front screen. We will explain the product in detail in the Product Description. The attachment below shows an example of how the fields would look for the product, and a first draft at a Product Description. I have only done a description of one product--at this time I am aware of three different products like this. Gerald, Steve-- I have made a feeble attempt at a Product Description--it obviously needs one of you to ""fix it up"". We can discuss my intent after you have had a chance to review it. Just call me once you decide who should handle this--Jeff Hodge suggested that I start with you two. Dave-- What does your schedule look like the rest of the week? I'd like to get together with you and get a timeline for introduction of this. Since I don't think there is any major programming at all, my impression is that we could get something out there as quickly as we can do all the legal work. I also need to know who else I need to include in this, what the next steps are, etc. Please let me know the process so we can get moving. Thanks for your assistance.",Neutral,2000

We have the following language in the Canadian ISDA Agreements: Limitation of Rate. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall the Default Rate, Non-default Rate, or Termination Rate exceed the maximum non-usurious interest rate, if any, that at any time or from time to time may be contracted for, taken, reserved, charged, or received on the subject indebtedness under the law applicable to such party. For the purpose of disclosure pursuant to the Interest Act (Canada), the yearly rate of interest to which any rate of interest payable under this Agreement that is calculated on any basis other than a full calendar year is equivalent may be determined by multiplying such rate by a fraction the numerator of which is the actual number of days in the calendar year in which such yearly rate of interest is to be ascertained and the denominator of which is the number of days comprising such other basis. Do we need to have the highlighted language exactly as it is, or can we have a general statement to the effect that the interest rate shall not exceed the maximun non-usurious rate and interest shall be paid on the actual number of days elapsed, based on a 365/366 day year?

You know we need to set aside some time to go get massages and facials and talk. Write back Sent: Monday, October 15, 2001 2:51 PM Hey girl!! When I opened up this e-mail I said, ""Wow""!! It has to be EXTREMELY SLOW to get an e-mail like this!! Girl you are so-oo crazy. Sounds like you were a true FOX last night. Thank goodness you weren't in Chicago, looking like that!! The outfit sounds cute. Doesn't it make you feel good when the kids admire you. I can relate to that warm, fuzzy feeling brought on by your child. I can't wait to see the pictures. I'm sorry to hear that you're having plumbing problems. Did Todd call a plumber last night? I wonder how expensive that job will be? I'm looking forward to rehearsal also. Where was V. Michael on Sunday? I was wondering where Samantha had been myself. I heard that she sang with the women 5th Sunday. I was thinking she had gone over to Higher Dimensions with Sis. Kaye. We need to visit that church and see what all the hupla is. Do you have a hat for next Sunday? After church, I went home & cooked spaghetti. Steve's cousin was giving a small family b-day gathering for his mom. I didn't want to go, but Steve asked me to. On the way home, he wanted to talk. He told me how much he loved me, etc... Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. It all sounded so familiar. He also apologized for the big blow up on Saturday. He even apologized to Siera for the things she heard. She told him that she didn't like the way he treated her mom. She really expressed herself. I was proud of her for speaking up. She was very respectful, but got her point across. I felt like he was only trying to make peace because he wanted some you know what. He wasn't getting off that easy. When we got in bed, he wanted to snuggle up under me. I then asked him where he had gone the other night. He immediately got an attitude. I asked again and he yelled, ""Why""! He then jumped out of the bed saying something about me questioning him as if he's 6 yrs. old. I said, ""Whatever, you've just confirmed what I feel so just go on & get out of here."" He's so-oo stupid! I'm his wife and can't ask where he's been. I should know where he is at all times. I just really don't have time for his mess.

It is truly a slow day over here. So far, I really could have taken the day off and would not have missed anything. Last night I had a date with my mother-in-law. She's a member of a book club and they had their 3rd annual literary Gala last night at the Omni Hotel. It was nice, but long. The tickets said it started at 6:00 and I got their at 6:00. The doggone ticket should have said cocktails at 6:00 and seating at 6:45. I was tired of standing around waiting to be seated. But, girl, Ms Thang felt so good last night. I felt like a million dollars in my semi-formal attire. After I left church, I went to one of my favorite stores, Chico's, and bought myself a nice dressy top to go with my floor length (not by design, I'm just not tall enough) black skirt. The top that I bought set it off so nicely. It was black, light brown and gold! I wore my rhinestone choker and my rhinestone big hoop earrings, not the ones I wear all the time, but a new pair, much mo' flashy and my black high heel sandals that show all my foot. Boy, I felt good about my appearance. When I came out of the bedroom after getting dressed, Jordan said ""Mommy.......you look pretty. Made my evening. Of course, Bozo the husband, didn't say one word. But I felt good, I even had Jordan take some pictures of me, so we'll see how those come out (smile). We have severe plumbng problems I discovered when I got back home, Todd said the septic tank is stopped up, I have no idea what that really entails, but it must of been ugly. He was pissed! Looking forward to rehearsal tomorrow night, speaking of rehearsal, I was wondering where Samantha had been, and Poiter told me yesterday that she's back in school, so that's why she's hasn't been there. How did your evening go last night? We still need to talk, maybe we'll get a chance to visit tonight. Todd already said he wasn't going to be home until around 11:00 p.m. on Mon, Tues, or Wed, of this week, due to Power Mart. I said fine, have fun. I am so bitter, I'm ready for a change too. Right now, it doesn't seem like me and the boys would be missing much. All we do is coordinate our schedules to see when we can schedule different, independent, activities. Plus, I'm ready for a new house, clean break and new environment. Oh well, talk with you later! Thanking you in advance for disregarding any and all typos! Sent: Friday, October 05, 2001 10:12 AM Hi Tricey!! How is your day going so far? Fine, I hope. I've been extremely busy. I'm glad it's Friday. Well, Siera received her report card yesterday and it's not good. I've almost cried myself into sickness. I don't know what else to do. I've prayed and given it to God, but she still struggles. We're seeking some outside tutoring right now. The 4th grade teacher at Southwest is going to tutor her. Keep her lifted up in prayer. She's pretty much given up completely. She thinks that she's dumb and that she'll be placed in special education. She wrote me a letter last night telling me to stop telling her that she's smart, because she's not. She said that she's dumb because her report card says so. That hurt me so bad. Lil' Steve's report card was excellent. He's doing a great job. The best thing we could've done for him was put him at Southwest. How's the school search going for Jordan?

Personality / Enthusiasm 1 Very energetic and ascited about the possibility of being a Texas MBA student. Maturity 2 She should not have any problem mixing with older, more-experienced students. Clarity of Professional Focus 2 Seems very focused on the potential opportunities following receiving an MBA degree, but is still open-minded. Please provide the Admission Committee with a brief narrative overview of your AdmissionVisit dialogue. You may use this opportunity to elaborate further on the above rankings. We had a very comfortable and open exchange of information regarding her work experience and views on current business topics.

Let's contact Wharton next week. Vince cc: Nelson Hi Vince, Nelson and I had a meeting yesterday with the Ag Desk folks on how to go forward on the analysis and presentation for this program. The consensus from the Ag side was that the choice of university will be highly politically driven, ie preferably the university should be from a state that has close ties to sympathetic senators or other political figures. Also it is preferable if the university faculty have worked on Ag issues before, lending more credibility in the Ag community. The names that came up were Mississippi State and Texas A&M. Nelson knows of a person at Mississippi State who worked with the USDA on risk management issues. The needed analysis itself is not necessarily very deep, and the focus is primarily to get a non-quantitative presentation out that outlines how Enron can take on the downside risk of local crop prices (Enron probably needs to cover actual local prices and not simply an index because I do not think the govt will want to worry about basis risk). The pilot program itself will be very small, and lends itself to continuing down the path of short term trading rather than long term origination. Another thought on hedging our potential short positon (on the origination side) is that the govt program can only provide a partial hedge to the extent of the premium received -- we still have unlimited downside from the short.

Therefore guaranteed salary is effectively o78,500 - this is completely separate and in addition to any performance bonus Increase the value of options to o60K to vest 1/3 as before - which leaves a 1/3 ($20,000 ) hanging out there at the end of the contract.

What can J Wilson do thru 2010? I want the crude desk to make us a price and present an acceptable volume. If we have to suggest to PDVSA only doing a crude index through 2012, I strongly believe we should try if we can create some additional value thru this structure. Tell me if you would like me to give him a call to explain what the effort potentially create. Thanks Eric Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. Eric cc: Per a conversation I had with John Wilson the head crude oil trader in the Houston office, the feasability of hedging price risk linked to WTI or Brent on a 20 year deal is NOT a possibility. If we had 1/3 of our GSA price linked to Brent our exposure for 20 years would be about 30 million barrels notional or about 14 million barrels PV. At 5% our exposure would still be 5 million notional or 2.3 million PV. According to John, he would not be comfortable doing anything past 2012 and even out that far he would not consider doing more than about 1 million PV barrels in the years 2010 - 2012. Given these comments, I would say that the size of our deal basically precludes a look at Crude Oil hedges at this time. As far as the economics of the deal are concerned, we basically cannot even get an Offer to use to figure out our economics. I am confident that if we pushed the issue to see if we could get a 20 year offer even for a small portion of the volumes that the hedging costs would be too high, and therefore have left it at that for the time being. Please advise if you have any thoughts on the issue. Thanks, Eric Guido 11/29/2000 09:27 AM cc: Emilio Larry Cris Brent A Eric Daniel R Eric, thanks for your comments. Please see below in blue our observations and answers. Let's talk later today if you have further questions. Saludos Guido and Emilio Enron Offtake Agreement Section 2 Should this agreement start at commercial hand over of the plant under the EPC agreement. Benefit here is LDs under the EPC for late delivery go to project company and project company has no obligation to lng buyers. In addition it preserves your 20 year offtake which should still match your GSA. The agreement should start at commercial hand over of the plant as you say. The draft as it is now has only outer limits as to when that should happen (that being the earlier of 40 months after Financial Close or NTP or Dec 31 2004). We will add to this list ""the earlier of"" something like: ""the date on which the plant has produced LNG at at least 90% of its capacity for a period of 10 consecutive days"". We suggest putting something like this as opposed to ""commercial hand over"" because this is in the plant's/contractor's control and they could, for example, on purpose not meet a noise level requirement for 4 months for example and delay commencement of the offtake contract while the project sells LNG at higher prices than in the term sheets. With regards to the EPC LDs we agree that they should go only to the project but we, as offtakers, can not wait for ever for the project to be completed with out receiving gas or damages for something that is somehow (directly or indirectly) under the project's control. We have 4 months limits to how much the project can be delayed on top of all the conservatism that EECC (or another EPC Contractor) already built in. Section 6 I would like to see some language in this section describing the pricing formula associated with expansions. Structure could be set as in this contract where Pg is to reflect GSA costs and where the combined value of Pcpi and Pa should be derived to provide an equity return to the sponsors of 18%. We agree that would be better, but we included this section knowing that is something that is going to be a very difficult sell with PDVSA, because they don't want us to sell down and then keep ""controlling"" new LNG businesses in Jose. They will oppose this clause as they violently opposed the limited exclusivity at Jose that we managed to include in the GSA. We think that adding a restriction to the asset's returns now in the draft will make it very tough to sell to PDVSA the entire Clause. Thus, jeopardizing our chance to control the output of future plants or expansions. We never intended to use these off-take agreements as a vehicle to control future LNG volumes. Nevertheless, we felt it was a good chance for us to start getting partial control of the output. Pushing it too much will back fire and PDVSA will clearly realize what our intent is. Section 7 Where is the bonus calculation? We did not include it now on purpose. We will include it when ever they ""remind"" us to do so. We want to have another fight about the bonus. Where is the min price? The minimum price is in. We say that one of the terms in the price is Pg x En where En is never less than one I thought you guys were going to trade out CPI for a fixed number? We are going to try to do it, but that is first a GSA issue, and we don't want to put it here as something firm before we change it in the GSA. We precisely bracketed the CPI percentage in the formula because of our thought that we want to make it zero Have you decided that a WTI index percentage does not help the economics? No, we don't have the definitive answer from structuring yet, but our guess and based on our meeting with RAC the other day, in which they told us about the mess created by an oil escalation in Cuiba (Brazil power plant), we are pretty much convinced that oil escalation without oil based LNG sales is not convenient. But since we don't have a definitive answer yet we still included oil as a possible escalator with a zero weighting (that should have been bracketed in the term-sheet, though, and it will). Section 10 you have incorporated the GSA default rate for late payment as opposed to the Equilibrium rate. Is this your intent to have a mismatch? Yes, we did it on purpose because this will apply also to PDVSA as off-taker, and they have a record of paying late so we want them to suffer if they do. you have all new taxes being borne by the project company. Will the banks accept this as the project company will be thinly capitalized. See section 18 of the Arcos CTA for ideas if this is an issue. The exporter of record will be the project, so the buyer has no business in Venezuela other than paying port fees. We do not see any kind of taxes that could be imposed on Buyer by Venezuela that would eventually be transferred to the project. Banks should be fine with this as this is a risk that projects typically take all the time (the heavy crude projects are some examples in Venezuela). In addition, the GSA provides for a number of reliefs for the Project Company that will help Banks and equity holders to feel safer. Although, a large portion of the underlying risk is always there. Other where are the LD calculations explained? I think you need LDs for GSA default and another for plant default. GSA default should match LD's in GSA contract less compensation to plant debt recovery. In stead of writing an explicit LD calculation our lawyers suggested that the sole use of New York law to rule the deal was simpler and better. New York law provides for full market based damages (market price of commodity plus extra costs) which is the maximum you can get in a negotiation for an LD clause. So, from a legal and commercial point of view we much rather have it as it is. We are still discussing w/ Brent Price and Cris Sherman if this is sellable to AA for MTM, but our initial view is that it should be since the level of LD can not be better. GSA default is market based (provided that PDVSA, as we expect, accepts the change we will propose) so the Project Company will be able to pay market based damages. For interruption of gas supply from PDV for Force Majeure reasons our insurance team is finding out if the market will cover such risk so that the project can afford not being relieved from performance in such event (this will obviously be to a maximum dollar limit to be determined and for a maximum period of time, say 36 months - we need time to give you precision on this, but some sort of coverage will be available). suppose the plant produces 5% less that it is supposed to due to design or tech problems (not a FM issue) at commercial hand over. What happens under the offtake agreements? Will the banks accept this revenue short fall? Will we have to create a reserve? This may be a big issue with the banks for technology reasons and lack of experience in this industry. Under the off-take agreements the project pays market based damages if it does not meet the contracted volume. We believe that the contracted volume that we included in the term sheets though has enough of a cushion for banks and equity holders to bear the risk. We are contracting for contractually guaranteed production under the EPC which is 3% lower than expected. On top of that we are considering LNG production with the richest inlet gas possible (meaning a lower LNG volume). This volume is 5% lower than the guaranteed production with ""Normal"" or expected feed composition. Combining these two we have a contracted quantity that is 8% lower than the expected production with expected feed. On top of this it is important to note that every single LNG plant in the world ended up with a production capacity that is at least 10% above what was expected (mostly due to EPC Contractors and tech partners making very safe assumptions on guaranteed volumes to avoid LDs). Also the EPC contract being negotiated provides for pretty severe LD in case of production shortfalls that are enough to pay for debt and make equity-holders whole. They don't provide though, for damages payable under off-take contracts (nobody will take this potentially huge exposure on LDs). However, as we explained, we believe that this is a risk that is typically taken by producers and that we have already taken a very conservative assumption in the volume contracted and that should be beard by the Project Co. Banks will most definitely also take a conservative volume assumption, as we already did. What happens if plant starts producing less for a few weeks until problem is resolved? what compensation do the offtakers get? do the banks suffer here as well? The term sheet establishes an annual quantity as the only standard to determine failure to deliver by Seller. It also establishes that deliveries should be at rates and intervals that are reasonably constant. The bottom line is that the termsheets do not go into all the detail about timing of defaults and price differentials. It sets, however, a reasonable standard by which if at the end of the year seller did not deliver the full annual quantity and a particular month can be identified where the deficiency occur based on the ""reasonable constant deliveries"" provision, damages will be payable based on prices during such month. Yes banks suffer here to the extent that the cause of the short fall is not insurable. Nevertheless, short periods (weeks) of failures to deliver by seller will really not affect the Project Company ability to pay the Banks. It will have to be some prolonged period for Banks to be affected. Under a plant FM issue you may not get BI cover for the first 60 days. Will the banks accept this or will they want a reserve established. Is this in your model? We are not sure off what the banks are going to require in this regard (although, we agree that some sort of reserve or LC is to be expected). Our model assumes the cost of an LC for 6 month debt service (which should be plenty). The issue here is if MTM is going to be able to live with the same or longer grace period for damages to kick in under the termsheet and weather damages (not BI) are insurable and to what extent if FM relief is not permitted for MTM reasons. The question that follows is: if damages exceed the insured limits in a FM event that does not relief the project from its obligation to deliver, have the damages have to be senior to debt payments for AA to allow MTM to be permitted? If this is so, are the banks going to be willing to live with this?, probably not. insert something on planned maintenance timing and scheduling. It is briefly covered in section 9 second paragraph. This will be expended in later drafts once the PA is signed and we are home free with regard to PDVSA. insert termination section In light of the fact that we will end up being more of an off-taker than an asset owner in this project our lawyers suggest that we will get better protection if early termination is ruled by what is provided under NY law than if we try to right an early termination clause. They point out also that 90% of LNG contracts are done in this way, having NY law rule the game. They point out also that from the project point of view banks are very used to and prefer having early termination be ruled by NY law. put something in about the buyer willing to accept entering direct agreements for financing requirements?

However, regarding power, it is my understanding that a Dec 01 fixed price deal in NEPOOL isn't decomposed into its respective legs, rather it goes into the system as a Dec 01 NEPOOL deal.

We can discuss further tomorrow. Sent: Tuesday, October 23, 2001 11:55 AM Jeff -- As always, your proposal is creative. After reviewing your presentation, here are some tough questions that we can discuss tomorrow: 1. Would the replacement energy from the market be obtained under contracts of similar length and firmness as the QF contracts that the energy replaces? If not, why would the CPUC want to replace long-term, committed QF power with short-term firm energy? WOULDN'T HAVE TO, BUT PRESUMABLY THE REPLACEMENT POWER WOULD BE CONSIDERABLY MORE ""DISPATCHABLE."" 2. Why would the CPUC want to replace long-term QF power over which it has substantial regulatory leverage (through SRAC pricing) with market energy from sources over which it may have less control? PRICES WOULD BE FIRM AND WOULD REDUCE POWER COSTS TO CONSUMERS SUBSTANTIALLY AND AVOID THE PROTRACTED, COSTLY LITIGATION THAT GOES ON INCESSANTLY BETWEEN EDISON AND QFS. (AND WOULD AVOID ALMOST LOSING THE QFS BASED ON CONTINUED NEGATIVE ACTIONS BY EDISON.) IN SHORT, ENDING THE HOLY WARS IS A GOOD THING. 3. Are there 8,000 MWs of low-cost replacement energy available in California, or in the WSCC with firm transmission to California? How steep is the supply curve for replacement energy? FORECASTS SHOW ONE HELLUVALOT OF POWER COMING ON LINE. HOWEVER, IF THERE WERE CONCERNS, THE MWS COULD BE CAPPED. 4. After a QF is bought out, I assume that it would simply operate in the electric market as a merchant plant, if it continues to operate to provide on-site power and thermal energy. Is this correct? YES. 5. How sensitive are your calculated ratepayer and QF benefits to changes in the relationship between SRAC (i.e. gas) and electric market prices? OBVIOUSLY, VERY CONNECTED. 6. Assuming that there are both ratepayer and QF benefits from QF contract buyouts, why is there a need for a formalized auction process, when the same benefits might be captured through bilateral negotiations (such as the QF buyouts done to date)? BILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS DO NOT EXIST. THEY ARE A MYTH. THIS TRIES TO GET AROUND THAT IMPASSE. 7. Doesn't your proposal require the utilities to be back in the power procurement business? If not, why not? THAT'S A GOOD THING. AND NO MORE THAN THEY WOULD BE OVER THE LIFE OF THE QF CONTRACTS. As you perhaps can tell, my questions focus on whether now is the right time for such a broad plan to buyout QF contracts. THERE ARE ALWAYS REASONS TO CONCLUDE THAT NOW IS NOT THE RIGHT TIME. ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE'S NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT. AND IF A QF HAS THE OPTION OF 1) RECEIVING THE NPV OF THE QF AND 2) RETAINING CONTROL OF THE ASSET, I'VE STRUGGLED MIGHTILY TRYING TO FIND A DOWNSIDE FOR THE QF. LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING TOMORROW. Talk to you tomorrow, Tom Tom: Here's the presentation that we'll go over with you tomorrow. If you have any questions between now and then, just give me a call at 415.782.7822.

For the one project that has come on line during the non-performance penalty could be in the range of $150,000 to $640,000, depending on the resoultion of the ""effective online date"" for said project. The non-performance penalty was our strongest negotiating point in the ongoing effort to restructure the agreement as there is a potential for penalties for each project for each year of the contract. The agreement contained some fundamenal flaws in order to be able to book the mark-to-market for the agreement. I do not have a good handle of the ""early termination payment"" except to say that there are approxmiately 390,500 MWh's. The average contract ""fixed price"" is $33.10 MWh. I would need to find out what the nine year fixed price from the power curves is to estimate but my best stab would be to estimate the nine year fixed price to be $25.00 MWh which would result in ""early termination payment"" of approximately $3,200,000 ((390,50033.10) - (390,50025.00)).

Sent: Tuesday, January 29, 2002 12:53 PM Mike, The ""deal"" is between EESI and Riverside County Waste Management Department (RCWMC) is dated April 17, 2000 and the term commenced on Sepetmber 1, 2000 and ending on September 1, 2010. Based on our bankruptcy filing RCWMD stopped delivery of power on December 6, 2001; RCWMD invoiced EESI for power production for September 2001, 0ctober 2001 and November 2001. I do not know if they were ever paid by EESI. I do not know of any invoice for the first six days of December 2001. EESI (myself) and EPMI (Chris Foster) were in the process of renegotiating the above referenced agreement with the plan for EPMI to take over the purchase of power and scheduling services with EESI being the purchaser of the ""green tickets"" from EPMI associated with the power production. There were some major issues to overcome in the renegotiation regarding the ""fixed price"", ""volume committments"" and ""penalties"". I do not know who, if anyone, is currently looking at this agreement to make any kind of determination EESI's and/or EPMI's desires for the future of this agreement. RCWMD sent various letters dated December 10, 2001, December 13, 2001, and January 8, 2002 requesting response from EESI. The December 10, 2001 letter indicates that RCWMD considers the agreement terminated effective December 2, 2001. I had previously spoke to you about this agreement in December 2001. It is my opinion that we should not continue this agreement and we should consider RCWMD's offer to terminate the agreement with the exchange of the non-performance panalties for the termination payment.

Hosiery was meticulously suspended from the forward edge of the wood burning caloric apparatus, pursuant to our anticipatory pleasure regarding an imminent visitation from an eccentric philanthropist among whose folkloric appellations is the honorific title of St. Nicholas (party of the second part). The prepubescent siblings, comfortably ensconced in their respective accommodations of repose, were experiencing subconscious visual hallucinations of variegated fruit confections moving rhythmically through their cerebrums. My conjugal partner and I, attired in our nocturnal head coverings, were about to take slumberous advantage of the hibernal darkness when upon the avenaceous exterior portion of the grounds there ascended such a cacophony of dissonance that I felt compelled to arise with alacrity from my place of repose for the purpose of ascertaining the precise source thereof. Hastening to the casement, I forthwith opened the barriers sealing this fenestration, noting thereupon that the lunar brilliance without, reflected as it was on the surface of a recent crystalline precipitation, might be said to rival that of the solar meridian itself - thus permitting my incredulous optical sensory organs to behold a miniature airborne runnered conveyance drawn by eight diminutive specimens of the genus Rangifer, piloted by a minuscule, aged chauffeur so ebullient and nimble that it became instantly apparent to me that he was indeed our anticipated caller. With his ungulate motive power traveling at what may possibly have been more vertiginous velocity than patriotic alar predators, he vociferated loudly, expelled breath musically through contracted labia, and addressed each of the octet by his or her respective cognomen - ""Now Dasher, now Dancer..."" et al. - guiding them to the uppermost exterior level of our abode, through which structure I could readily distinguish the concatenations of each of the 32 cloven pedal extremities. As I retracted my cranium from its erstwhile location, and was performing a 180-degree pivot, our distinguished visitant achieved - with utmost celerity and via a downward leap - entry by way of the smoke passage. He was clad entirely in animal pelts soiled by the ebony residue from oxidations of carboniferous fuels which had accumulated on the walls thereof. His resemblance to a street vendor I attributed largely to the plethora of assorted playthings which he bore dorsally in a commodious cloth receptacle. His orbs were scintillant with reflected luminosity, while his submaxillary dermal indentations gave every evidence of engaging amiability. The capillaries of his malar regions and nasal appurtenance were engorged with blood which suffused the subcutaneous layers, the former approximating the coloration of Albion's floral emblem, the latter that of the Prunus avium, or sweet cherry. His amusing sub- and supralabials resembled nothing so much as a common loop knot, and their ambient hirsute facial adornment appeared like small, tabular and columnar crystals of frozen water. Clenched firmly between his incisors was a smoking piece whose grey fumes, forming a tenuous ellipse about his occiput, were suggestive of a decorative seasonal circlet of holly. His visage was wider than it was high, and when he waxed audibly mirthful, his corpulent abdominal region undulated in the manner of impectinated fruit syrup in a hemispherical container. He was, in short, neither more nor less than an obese, jocund, multigenarian gnome, the optical perception of whom rendered me visibly frolicsome despite every effort to refrain from so being. By rapidly lowering and then elevating one eyelid and rotating his head slightly to one side, he indicated that trepidation on my part was groundless. Without utterance and with dispatch, he commenced filling the aforementioned appended hosiery with various of the aforementioned articles of merchandise extracted from his aforementioned previously dorsally transported cloth receptacle. Upon completion of this task, he executed an abrupt about-face, placed a single manual digit in lateral juxtaposition to his olfactory organ, inclined his cranium forward in a gesture of leave-taking, and forthwith effected his egress by renegotiating (in reverse) the smoke passage. He then propelled himself in a short vector onto his conveyance, directed a musical expulsion of air through his contracted oral sphincter to the antlered quadrupeds of burden, and proceeded to soar aloft in a movement hitherto observable chiefly among the seed-bearing portions of a common weed. But I overheard his parting exclamation, audible immediately prior to his vehiculation beyond the limits of visibility: ""Ecstatic Yuletide to the planetary constituency, and to that self same assemblage, my sincerest wishes for a salubriously beneficial and gratifyingly pleasurable period between sunset and dawn.""",Neutral,1998

The revised document is attached. As Jeff and I agreed today, we are going to restructure the floating rate forward so that it will be a fixed rate forward. We will therefore use the same confirmation for both transactions. We will restructure the forward as of 12/26/00 using $73.6797 as the base price. This price represents the forward price as of 12/12 ($73.5941) plus interest up to 12/26 ($0.2107) less the dividend paid on 12/20 ($0.1251). The rate we will use to calculate the interest on the forward will be interpolated between 3 and 4 month LIBOR set on 12/26 plus 65 basis points. The forward price will be reduced by the expected dividend of $0.125 per share paid around 3/20/01. The maturity of the forward will remain April 12, 2001.

If you could send me a business proposal or summary of what your doing, that would be helpful. With regards to Columbia Business School, I applied last year and did not get in due to my GMAT score. I decided to take a graduate level finance class this summer, which I received an A. I am currently taking another graduate finance class this semester. I am also retaking the GMAT, with the hopes of increasing my quantitative score. Last year, I was asked back for an interview, which I felt was a good sign. I heard from one of my recommenders that the only thing that I needed to improve on was my GMAT score. Recently, I wrote a brief letter to the Dean of Admissions, Linda Meehan, informing her of my recent actions as well as my continued interest with Columbia. I hope that these actions will help me get into Columbia this year. My desire to go to Columbia, stems from their network, location, reputation and curriculum. Since growing up in Pelham, it would be nice to get back to New York for a little while. As you can see, my desire to go to Columbia is very strong. I hope this brief e-mail has provided some insight into what I'm doing to get into Columbia. I hope we can meet for lunch sometime soon either up in the Woodlands or downtown.

On July 26, 2000, two friends, Jim and John, each received a $1000 bonus at work. (They both work for Nortel Networks, where in the summer of 2000, there was LOTS of money around for bonuses). Jim, being an intelligent, financially conscientious person, put the whole $1000 into Nortel Networks stock. With his $1000, and the transaction cost of $35, he was able to purchase 7 shares at $123 each. Having watched the Nortel stock climb and climb, he felt very good about this investment, happy that he is preparing for the future. John, being a more care-free sort, did something slightly different with his $1000. John borrowed a friend's truck, and proceeded to the Beer Store, where he purchased 33 cases of beer. John also felt very good about his investment: 33 cases x 24 = is 792 bottles of beer! John, also being an intelligent guy, although perhaps not as forward-thinking as Jim, calculated that he could drink about 15 bottles per week, and he wouldn't have to buy beer for a whole year. Jim, of course, was appalled by John's purchase, and berated him constantly about it. As months went by, Jim excitedly watched the stock prices, and saw it start to dwindle. ""It'll go back up"", he'd say to Jim. Jim, who has been reaping the benefits of his investment on a daily basis, would reply, ""Ya, it will. Hang in there buddy ""burp"". Months went by, and the value of the stock continued to fall, and there was the beginnings of a noticeable dent in the beer pile. Midwinter came, Jim's stock had fallen to about half of it's original value, and John's beer was about half gone. Jim, being sure that the stock had hit rock-bottom, still was berating John for his frivolous purchase, telling him ""Your beer will be gone in six months! Who knows what my stock will be worth!!"". Well, summer has come, and hard times at Nortel continue. Bad news: Both John and Jim have been affected by the layoffs. Last week, in order to raise some cash to help through the rough time, Jim sold his 7 shares, at that day's value of $12, and got $84, then after paying the $35 transaction fee, he only had $49. Jim stopped by John's house later that day (everyone needs their friend's during rough times), and as luck would have it, there were two bottles of John's beer left. John, being a good, compassionate friend, offered to share his last two bottles of beer with his friend. Jim appreciated the gesture, and enjoyed the cold beer on the hot summer's day, but he felt a bit guilty. ""At least I got fifty bucks back out of it - you have nothing now."", he said. ""That's ok."", replied John. ""Perhaps you can help me, I need to return all these empties."", he added as his other friend with the truck pulled in. So, they loaded up the truck, and proceeded off to the beer store. Upon arrival at the beer store, they unloaded the empties, feeling a little grim. John went to the counter, and collected his refund for the bottles. ""33 cases x 24 bottles, at 10 cents per bottle, that comes to $79.20"", the friendly Beer Store clerk said to John as he handed him the money. Jim was speechless. Poor guy. Can you imagine how you would feel if you just discovered that over the course of the last year, your $1000 stock investment left you with $50, and taking same $1000, buying beer, and drinking it, would leave you with $80.

The purpose of the Act is to eliminate unnecessary regulation of commodity futures exchanges and other entities falling within the coverage of the Commodities Exchange Act (""CEA"") and the provide legal certainty with regard to certain futures and derivatives transactions. By enacting such changes, Congress intends to promote product innovation and to enhance the competitive position of US financial markets. Certain provisions of the Act open the door for Enron's further product innovation and growth. Specifically, the Act provides important legal certainty for energy and other transactions occuring both on an over-the-counter (OTC) bilateral basis and on multilateral electronic trading platforms. Enron was a leading advocate of passage of this legislation. Bilateral Transactions Under the Act, bilateral transactions in all commodities (other than agriculture commodities) that do not occur on trading facility (i.e. not on a multi-party exchange) are exempt from most provisions of the CEA as long as the transactions are entered solely between ""eligible contract participants""(i.e. persons and certain legal entities satisfying capital thresholds and other requirements under the Act). This provision essentially codifies and expands existing CFTC exemptions for swaps and forward contracts, thereby eliminating a degree of legal ambiguity that has frustrated product innovation and growth. Multilateral Transactions In addition, the Act creates a broad exemption for any agreement, contract or transaction in commodities (other than agriculture commodities) so long as they the transactions are between ""eligible commercial participants"", are entered into on a ""principle-to-principle basis"" and that take place on a multi-party ""electronic facility"". This exemption could facilitate expansion of EnronOnline to allow for multi-party transactions, however certain legal requirements will have to be met. Other Transactions The Act also creates a broad exclusion for a number of commodities that are of interest to Enron, including ""credit risk measure"" commodities and weather derivatives . Again, the derivative transaction exclusion will have to meet certain legal thresholds. This legislation has been over six years in the making and the collective support of many Enron employees has been crucial. Thank you to all that have contributed to the passage on this important legislation. We will have a more through legal summary of this legislation in the near future.

Thanks, Kay cc: Kathleen, the signature pages are for a CLOSING NEXT FRIDAY, December 28 in Washington DC. The pages are for a Consent to an Assignment of a completed EPC contract involving a special purpose company of Tampa Electric Company (""TECO""). ECT's role was to purchase the turbines and NEPCO did the work. The work has been completed but is still in the warranty phase and thus the banks want this assignment agreement so that can also enjoy the warranty rights. The document is complex because the financing structure is complex (there is prior existing senior debt, new subordinated debt and a sale and lease back structure.) My understanding is that Janet Dietrich did the original transaction. If you want a copy of the Consent Agreement as modified, please call Angie and she will fax it to you. Also, you can leave me a voicemail if you want me to debrief someone on the project. In addition, you can tell people that Jason Peters of Andrews & Kurth also helped in the review and editing of the contract. If you want to call him directly he can describe the deal to you (he indicated that he has worked with you.) Lastly, you will need to fax an executed copy of the agreement to Babak Hoghooghi of the Washington, DC office of Skadden Arps and will need to federal express the originals to him as well. I am giving him your name as his contact at ENA. I have already sent him the NEPCO signed pages. Thanks and happy new year.

We had a nice Thanksgiving here too. It's funny, because usually it's just me, Mom, Craig and Danelia, and Danelia doesn't really like roasted turkey or roast beef (not that she would say it to me!), so there is not just the same joy in cooking it would be elsewise. It was good having the girls down. We played a new version of Uno called ""African Uno"" that was complex, fast and at times, physically challenging. It's not for the meek. It was incredible what a good player Alena was. She had her cards memorized as well as everyone elses (when you play you'll see why you can know everyone elses hands!). I expect Craig didn't want Mom to see his place because it was messy. I think compared to my house, he's embarrased about his apartment. Then, also, he's got so much stuff in there right now, that I don't know how he's going to fit baby stuff. They would only give him a 6 month lease when he renewed his lease last month because they don't want 3 people in that small apartment. So he's going to have to start looking for another place. And his apartment is so run down down I'm afraid roaches might be crawling over the baby. I guess Mom is going to come back down sometime in March or April to see the new baby. You'll have to come visit to check out my new house. The upstairs ""guest suite"" is pretty neat. It's got its own bathroom and tv, and is pretty cozy. As far as the call with Uncle Ben goes, if he was thrilled to hear from me I couldn't tell by his voice. It was a pretty stilted conversation for both of us. But, I guess, it's a start... I've already made my XMAS plans. I leave the evening of the 21st, my flight comes in about 10 pm, and leave the morning of the 27th at 6 am. It's good chatting with you.

Thanks. Lynn Sent: Friday, August 31, 2001 9:33 AM Transwestern Denies Withheld Capacity to Boost Negotiated Deals A Transwestern Pipeline executive yesterday dismissed allegations that the pipeline withheld firm transportation capacity bound for California from its recourse-rate shippers last winter in order to free up more capacity for contracts at substantially higher negotiated rates. Mary Kay Miller, vice president of rates and certificates, acknowledged Transwestern may have had discussions and exchanged faxes (prior to posting its available capacity) with two shippers -- Sempra Energy and Richardson Products II Ltd. -- that subsequently entered into negotiated-rate transactions. But she stressed that requests for capacity by Sempra Energy and Richardson were considered ""moot"" by the pipeline until after the available operational capacity was posted. ""Even if they would have sent...a fax the day before"" capacity became available, ""it would have been irrelevant because there was no capacity posted"" at that time, said Miller. Capacity requests that came in prior to Jan. 31, the day that available capacity was posted for February contracts on Transwestern, were ""null and void."" The only ""relevant"" ones were those that Transwestern received on or after Jan. 31, she noted. Miller spent much of Wednesday on the stand being quizzed by lawyers for FERC and producers about Transwestern's methods for notifying customers about available capacity, the manner in which it chooses winning bids and about its pre-posting contacts with Sempra Energy and Richardson. It was the first day of a FERC hearing exploring charges that Transwestern exercised market power in awarding negotiated-rate contracts that led to shippers being charged as much as $27/MMBtu last February, far in excess of the pipeline's maximum allowed rate of 38 cents/MMBtu for firm transportation service to the California border. The Commission proceeding yesterday focused on four negotiated-rate contracts of Sempra Energy and Richardson for a total 45,000 MMBtu/d of service on Transwestern during February and March. Richardson and Sempra ""clearly did not have any 'deal' entitling them to the posted capacity before it was posted,"" Miller said in prepared rebuttal testimony. The two companies ""had the right to the capacity only 'after' they submitted their bids, 'after' the posting period ended, 'after' Transwestern determined that no other bids were submitted, and 'after' a contract was agreed upon between Transwestern, Richardson or Sempra,"" she noted. Despite claims made by FERC energy industry analyst Barry E. Sullivan to the contrary, ""Transwestern did not withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available under recourse rates in order to make the capacity available under substantially higher negotiated rates,"" Miller testified. Sullivan, an analyst in the FERC Office of Markets, Tariffs and Rates' (OMTR) Division of Litigation, contends that Transwestern threatened to withhold capacity unless shippers agreed to negotiated rates (see Daily GPI, Aug. 29 < In fact, he believes the pre-posting discussions between Transwestern and shippers were intended to raise doubts about the availability of capacity at the maximum recourse rate, so that shippers might be more ""willing to enter into negotiated-rate contracts above the recourse rate, in the hope of securing some of the capacity if and when [it became] available."" But Miller counters that Sullivan ""offers not support for his claim."" She noted that even Sempra Energy and Richardson, in response to a data request by Southern California Edison, support Transwestern's claims. Both companies replied ""no"" when asked whether ""any employee of Transwestern or any Transwestern affiliate ever indicated at any time that Transwestern would not provide the capacity at the maximum tariff rate."" The ""capacity at issue was offered on Transwestern's web site at the recourse rate in the exact same manner that all other capacity is offered on Transwestern's web site at the recourse rate; there was no prohibition, restrictions, limitation, condition or suggestion that a potential shipper could not bid for the capacity at the recourse rate; and any potential shipper, including Richardson or Sempra, could have submitted a bid for the capacity at the recourse rate."" Sullivan contends that Transwestern's motive for allegedly advancing negotiated-rate transactions at the expense of recourse-rate deals was pure profit. Under questioning by Thomas J. Burgess of FERC's OMTR, Miller conceded that Transwestern earned $1.8 million from Sempra Energy's contract in March, $1.3 million from Richardson's March contract, and a ""comparable"" amount from Richardson's February contract. She noted the pipeline received a ""substantially higher"" amount as a result of Sempra's February contract, but she didn't provide an exact figure. FERC's Sullivan estimated the pipeline's profit from the Sempra February contract was more than $5 million. Sullivan said that much of the profits that wound up in Transwestern's coffers would have gone to Sempra Energy and Richardson if they have been able to acquire the capacity at recourse rates. But Miller countered that the Commission's negotiated-rate policy ""does not require a minimum level of profit to shippers or contemplate any hindsight analysis of whether shippers could have gotten a better deal or made more profits."" Furthermore, she said the Transwestern case shouldn't be used to consider changes to the negotiated-rate policy, as Sullivan has suggested. This case ""is the wrong forum for such an issue because modifying the negotiated-rate policy should only be done on an industry-wide basis so no pipeline or group of pipeline customers is competitively disadvantaged.""",Neutral,2001

It is a standard interruptible form, so we should have no issues with interruption of the gas flows. I also talked further with Dan concerning the contract. We feel that the agreement strictly refers to facilities that are directly operated by the state (e.g. universities and prisons) and not school districts. Thus, we would consider HISD to not be state facilities. This argument is not a slam dunk, but we should probably take this approach and see how they react. The contract also refers to gas ""destined"" for state facilities. So the fact that the gas goes through another pipeline before being delivered to a state facility does not matter.

The guy's name is Joao Neves (Portugese).? I think he is reasonably bright and seems to have a quite deep understanding of general finance and financial mathematics. He is a manager and feels very frustrated because he had hoped to be promoted to a position of authority. Instead the group's M.D. brought in two Price-Waterhouse-Coopers consultants as V.P's to run the structuring and quant sides of the group. In this respect, I can understand his unhappiness. Unfortunately for him, however, I also think it is in his nature to whine.? I have observed him to bad mouth lots of people starting with the IT guys (ok, that's perhaps not much an indictment!) all the way to dismissing Broadie & Glasserman's or Eduardo Schwartz' works as shoddy or shallow.? He does not seem to suffer well people he considers fools.? Caveat Emptor, therefore! Having said all this, I do want to emphasize that he is a bright guy, is very pleasant with me, and, perhaps given the appropriate environment and supervision, might be quite productive.? But don't take my word for it. Talk to him, and see what you think.? Obviously, I would ask that you keep these comments in confidence. I have given you an honest assessment -- brutally so. ?

Re: Confidential,kay.chapman@enron.com,dlhart1@aep.com,"Mon, 13 Nov 2000 05:31:00 -0800 (PST)",<15268951.1075854464865.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"David W Delainey 11/13/2000 10:55 AM cc: Brian Timothy J Dwayne, in response to your request, I am providing a quick summary of our discussion on Friday. As I had mentioned, this is a competitive process and time is of the essence. If we get resolution to these points, I would be prepared to sit down over a finite period of time (three or four days) to try and hammer out the transaction. Specifically: AEP Point #2: ENA would accept a triggering event and MAC clause for the lease. This would under certain conditions allow AEP to purchase the leased assets at the present value of the future lease payments plus the fair value in year thirty of the underlying assets at an agreed upon discount rate. The triggering events would include bankruptcy, insolvency or Enron Corp falling below investment grade. An Enron Corp guarantee would be offered to secure that covenant. We would similarly ask for similar credit language in the lease agreement, with an AEP parental guarantee, securing the lease obligation from AEP. These paragraphs would be constructed in a similar manner to triggering events and MAC clauses in master commodity documents. ENA would also acknowledge that it would not sell the lease or physical assets underlying the lease to any other party but AEP. I would anticipate that this would be managed through a ROFR structure. This would ensure that AEP would have access to the assets if sold and that AEP can feel confortable that they will be dealing with Enron for the period of the lease. Notwithstanding above, Enron needs the flexibility to pledge or sell the AEP lease stream in order to monetize your obligation to cash if desired. This makes the set-off language difficult. With the triggering event and MAC clause, the need for set-off to protect AEP in the event of Enron default should not be required. AEP Point #5: ENA would agree to a three month non-compete which prohibits ENA from soliciting business with the suppliers or producers connected to the Pipeline. This non-compete would apply to transactions over one month in duration. This would apply to ENA only and no other Enron Corp affiliates. AEP Point #6: I believe that ENA has already agreed in principal to your request under this point. AEP Point #1: ENA would require indemnity limitation, including representation and warranties and basic construction, similar to our last draft language previously provided to you. Would also request a two year window rather than three on environmental claims. AEP Point #3: ENA would counter with a $40 million break up fee if AEP does not get requisite SEC approval by April 1, 2001. AEP Point #4: On HSR and FERC approvals, AEP's position as layed out in the letter is not practical since it would be very difficult to pull out certain pieces of the pipe from the deal and ensure that both parties get the benefit of the bargain. If AEP is unwilling to give an asset divestment covenant and given AEP's limited gas infrastructure position, ENA's position is that AEP should take the risk that they will be able to get the approvals. Other: ENA will not agree as a condition to this transaction a settlement of any FERC issues between AEP and EPMI; however, ENA would always be willing to discuss such items in a different forum. If you have any questions or comments do not hesitate to contact myself or Tim Detmering. Regards Dave Delainey",Neutral,2000

I wish I could tell you these are the final (or even the most recent) versions of the documents but things have changed so frequently that I'm afraid these may not be quite up to date. They do have the advantage of being in my directory and therefore available to send to you today. I don't think the final changes will be significant but if you want to use these as starting points, please let me know so I can be sure you have the latest material. The PA is the Password Application which is the only document the prospective counterparty actually signs by putting pen to paper. The first time the counterparty logs on to the system with its approved password, it is required to agree to the ETA (Electronic Trading Agreement) by clicking on an ""I Agree"" box after scrolling through the agreement. The GTC's are the contractual terms that apply to online transactions if there is no master agreement in place. Legal will have the ability to restrict a counterparty to trading only certain products online if we feel it is necessary. While most financial transactions will be governed by GTC's that look like our ""Omnibus"" documentation, the weather derivatives look more like a ""Deemed ISDA."" One final complication, the credit group has asked us to create two sets of documents: one for highly creditworthy counterparties which will have no credit provisions included and a second set for counterparties credit is not quite comfortable with which will contain a provision allowing us to call for collateral if we choose.",Neutral,1999

Media Action: In addition to doing behind the scenes editorial board meetings and the like, I would suggest that we get our coalition lined up and ready to release statements for certain key events which are likely to occur over the next several weeks, such as: 1. SDG&E's selection of the winning bid to their RFP. Even if Enron isn't selected as the winning bid, the coalition should trumpet the market-based solution and the enormous market response to SDG&E's RFP. 2. The Commission vote on UCAN's Emergency Motion. We should be prepared to issue a statement whether the Cmmn votes with us or against us. With us, the market can and did provide reasonable, expedient solutions to SDG&E's customers and protection from price spikes. Against us, despite the overwhelming market response, the Cmmn chose to ignore the market solutions and impose more regulation. 3. Potential for ARM members to surface a Provider of Last Resort proposal within the next couple of weeks. 4. ISO Bd. Mtg-keep up pressure against reducing price caps. Coalition Members: Agree that those groups listed should be contacted, although the CMA, CRA, CIU, CLECA have been luke-warm in their advocacy. I would add our customers (UC/CSU (especially the San Diego branch), PacTel, etc.) NewEnergy has indicated that Kroger/Ralph's grocery stores, San Diego-based, would give testimonials. I could solicit the members of ARM to identify a key customer contacts for interviews. We could check with our lobbyists and see who they would recommend (wine growers, dairy industry, etc.) We should also consider the water agencies and the rural counties and the City of Pittsburg. While the immediate message is responding to San Diego's situation, this latter group of potential coalition members would go to the larger message (keeping benefits of competitive markets) from a state-wide perspective. What about the City of Pittsburg? Jeff Dasovich on 07/18/2000 10:07:00 AM Paul Peggy Karen Jeff Mona L Susan J Sandra cc: Here's a draft.

Sent: Sunday, November 25, 2001 7:15 PM Steve, I think you may have heard a request last week re working closely with Dynegy. I think we just need to treat them like other counterparties. Basically, West Power would like to enter into arms length physical power and service transactions with Dynegy. My understanding is that Dynegy is a separate, unrelated party until the merger closes. Therefore, we can not ""collaborate"" with them commercially and our transaction policy is dictated by customary credit, legal and risk management procedures. Is this correct? If so, how do you feel about the following? An Enron customer wants to buy power and related services for one year. The customer requires Enron to post collateral. Enron does not want to post collateral but suggests that Enron can provide the product/services to Dynegy and Dynegy can then sell to the customer. The Enron marketer calls the Dynegy marketer and proposes a ""back to back"" transaction. Dynegy adds a small service fee, the Enron/Dynegy contract is executed and a Dynegy/Customer contract is executed. This type of deal happens frequently - it is usually driven by the third party having better credit, transmission access or a complementary service. We could do this with anyone, but the obvious choice is Dynegy - customers think it makes sense, and ultimately if we merge we have retained a customer. Do you think this works?

These assets are viable businesses that represent Enron's roots. If we are able to move quickly, we believe this 363 Sale process will allow us to maximize the value of these assets. We intended to rollout our plan to employees early next week following the presentation to the Creditors' Committee. However, the Wall Street Journal got a relatively final draft of our plan and were prepared to run a story today. To ensure accuracy, we decided to work with the Journal on their story and I participated in an interview late yesterday afternoon. I certainly regret that you have to learn about our plans from the media rather than directly from me or other members of the management team. Yet until we present to the Creditors' Committee, we are still not at liberty to share the full details of the plan with employees. We look forward to proceeding with our rollout early next week. In the meantime, we've attached below the article from the Wall Street Journal. Enron Plans Return to Its Roots --- Draft Proposal to Creditors Envisions a Smaller Firm Focused on Hard Assets By Rebecca Smith and Mitchell Pacelle The Wall Street Journal Enron Corp. plans to reorganize as a small company under a new name, according to a draft copy of the firm's plans -- returning to its roots of a decade ago, before the aggressive strategy that led to its spectacular expansion and then collapse. Under plans scheduled to be presented to creditors Friday, Enron would carve out a small integrated energy company with assets of about $10 billion in North and South America. The new entity would likely take a new name in order to escape the taint of Enron's fall and the baggage of numerous investigations into its finances. It would then be put on the block in bankruptcy court, quickly giving Enron's creditors the choice to retain a stake in the new company -- or sell it off, whole or in parts, if more attractive bids emerge. Enron lost the confidence of creditors and investors as revelations emerged last fall that the Houston-based company had hid debt and pumped up profit through a series of off-balance-sheet ventures that in some cases enriched a handful of senior executives. After failing to merge with rival Dynegy Corp., the company sought bankruptcy-court protection in December, the largest such filing in U.S. history. The new plan calls for a small operating company -- for now dubbed ""OpCO Energy Co."" -- to own power plants, electric utilities, natural-gas pipelines and liquefied-natural-gas facilities, but little else. The biggest properties would be the Portland General Electric utility in Oregon; Elektro, a Sao Paulo-based Brazilian utility and about 15,000 miles of pipeline assets on both continents -- less than half the amount of pipes that Enron once possessed. The plan would essentially make the Enron successor little different from other U.S. energy companies that provide electricity and natural gas, giving it few advantages over competitors. It would also make the new company more reliant than ever on volatile South American operations at a time when its U.S. rivals are scaling back their commitments in the region. Nevertheless, Enron's new management team, headed since January by restructuring specialist Stephen Cooper, hopes that the creation of a new company will protect the assets it needs from a long bankruptcy-reorganization process that could hurt their value. Under the company's plan, all of Enron's other assets would be liquidated in that process. The number of employees would drop steeply -- from about 23,000 today (already down from a peak of 31,000 before the bankruptcy) to around 12,000. ""In my view, we're going to be in bankruptcy for a number of years, because of the difficulty we're going to have resolving all of the claims,"" Mr. Cooper said in an interview yesterday afternoon, after Enron's board had met to go over the plan. A spinoff, he said, also could protect the new business from problems stemming from the bankruptcy such as customers wary of entering into new contracts and a welter of litigation and competing claims. Customers who otherwise might shun Enron could embrace the new company, Mr. Cooper predicted: ""Once we're out from under, what they will see is a company with great assets and great cash flow that can stand on its own two legs."" Enron's creditors wield enormous influence over how the bankruptcy reorganization will unfold. Mr. Cooper and his advisers will have to convince these unsecured creditors -- who have asserted billions of dollars in claims -- that they stand to recover more of their money by turning Enron's core assets into a new company than selling them off in a fire sale. Because Enron now owes a fiduciary obligation to them, these creditors have the power to press the company to alter the plan considerably, or to proceed directly to a liquidation. ""The [creditors'] committee has a bunch of bright, reasonable businesspeople on it,"" said Mr. Cooper. ""Their goal, to maximize value, is consistent with ours. I'm confident that we will be able to make a case for value maximization by adopting this approach."" Luc Despins, a lawyer for the creditors' committee, said he hadn't yet seen the plan and couldn't comment. Protracted negotiations are likely to follow the Friday meeting. If and when Enron reaches an accord with creditors, Enron will file the plan with the bankruptcy court, which must then approve it. The proposed reorganization would sweep away a decade of rapid growth, returning the company to its size in 1992, when former Chairman Kenneth Lay and then-President Richard Kinder were running the company. Four years later, Mr. Kinder left Enron and was replaced by Jeffrey Skilling, under whose leadership the company began to disparage hard assets and emphasize the energy-trading business that eventually turned Enron into a far larger concern. Whether the new company can escape the taint of Enron is far from certain. ""The success of OpCo as a going concern will depend on its ability to separate reputationally from Enron,"" the draft business plan says. In addition to winning support from creditors, Enron must disentangle itself from many complicated financial arrangements and an existing agreement to sell Portland General Electric to Northwest Natural Gas Co., a deal which hasn't yet closed. In recent months, new managers have devoted considerable energy to trying to understand Enron's complicated financial arrangements. They are also trying to unravel the contents of a plethora of ""SPEs"" or special-purpose entities. They were created, beginning in the mid-1990s, as a way to pump up profits, hide debt and raise money from outside investors. The draft plan contains a list of assets Enron wishes to retain for the new company, some of which may be entangled in these special-purpose entities. For example, Centragas, a pipeline company in Colombia, is a proposed asset of the new company. But separate, internal spreadsheets reviewed by The Wall Street Journal show that controlling interest of that pipeline already had been pledged to two investment vehicles, Rawhide LP and Whitewing LP. They, in turn, may have passed along interests to other Enron entities, Tombstone Assets LLC and Ponderosa Assets LP. The company said it is trying to ""unwind"" many of the investment vehicles to gain clear title to the assets for the new company, but it cautioned that ""the unwind and resolution of these structures may affect the financial results presented"" for the new company. If the new company is created as outlined, its pro forma net income -- based on past performance of the units it hopes to retain -- is projected to be $243 million this year, $352 million next year, $450 million in 2004 and $503 million by 2005. That is based on assets of $10.1 billion currently, rising to $11 billion by 2003. That's a far cry from what Enron claimed at its peak. In 2000, the last year that full financial records were posted by the company, Enron said its net income was $979 million on $100.8 billion in revenue. Those numbers -- as well as financial statements in the previous three years -- were eventually retracted as Enron came under increasing scrutiny from investors and regulators. The plan said the company wants to keep enough assets to form the basis of a new company because the market is ""already overloaded with properties for sale"" and prices aren't very good. Enron's collapse is partly to blame for that market glut, because credit standards have been tightening, forcing many energy firms to shed assets and pare debt.",Neutral,2002

As we are successful in signing up counterparties to reach a critical mass, we'll be adding products that are closer to the front of the curve (less correlated to NG.)

This notification from the agency originally came to Rick Loveless by way of Wayne Brunette. I called the TNRCC and spoke to Kevin Cauble concerning the NOV and he pulled the emissions inventory submitted in 1999 for the facility. Because VOC's are the issue, I asked him what the emissions were for VOC's on the 1999 inventory. Kevin stated that the inventory showed VOC emissions of 19.50 tons/yr actuals and 33.56 tons/yr potentials. We discussed why EOTT would submit an inventory as it is not a major source and not required to. The only thing we could come up with is that EOTT may have anticipated an increase in throughput at this site and therefore, wanted to ensure that this facility was shown as a title V source. According to the phone records from the TNRCC for this facility, Craig Willoughby of Entrix had requested that the faciltiy be kept on the list of facilities required to do inventories. I have a call into EOTT to determine whether increased throughput is proposed for this facility in the near future. In speaking with Kevin, he suggested that if a determination is made that if there is to be an increased throughput that wont exceed the 100 ton/yr limit on VOC's, or that throughput conditions remain approximately consistent with previous years, EOTT should provide written notification to the agency that this facility does not meet the applicability requirements of 101.10 (emissions inventory requirements) and request that this facility be removed from the TNRCC mailings. Should EOTT confirm the status of operating throughput to be below the 100 ton/yr VOC emissions limit, I will make make written notification to the TNRCC requesting removal from the list.",Neutral,2001

I hope everything is working out well for you. I know you had to go back to court last week and I was wondering how that went for you. Everything here is the same. The boys are still being ""the boys"". They're alot of fun. Todd is still being Todd. Although I must say, I think he's getting a little concerned regarding my somewhat ""cavalier"" attitude. Nothing seems to really bother me that much any more, because I've made some resolutions in my own mind that work for me. I guess I better start fussing at him more to get him back on track (not). I thought for a moment that I might be visiting Chicago again real soon and even contemplated spending the weekend to do some shopping on Michigan Avenue, but I don't know now. Our company, in case you haven't heard, is really going through. Out senior management allegedly was involved in some ""suspect"" deals and joint ventures that have cost this company dearly. We are suddenly finding ourselves going from hero to zero in a ""heartbeat"". Last year around this time, Enron's stock was trading at $85 plus and right now our stock is trading at $11.29. Just since news of this scandal came out a week and a half ago (we took a $1 billion third quarter write-down), we've come down from $30 to $11 (roughly speaking). It hurts, and it appears that it's all because of 5 or 6 senior level executives. If this company survives this, it will truly be a miracle. Pray for me and pray for Enron. How are the girls doing? I know they're doing fine. How's Cecelia? Tell her we said hello. How's Uncle Charlie? Any word when Grandpa Thurston is moving down or is that still on hold? I know Todd talks to Sherry alot, so I know she's doing fine. How's the yoga instructor? I attended the Harlem Dance Theater Production lasts Friday night with a girlfriend. Interesting, although, I found out I really don't have an appreciation for that ballet ""thang"". I was hoping for more ""sho nuff"" modern dance. It was interesting, but now worth the $50 I spent. My girlfriend and I went to a club afterwards....what an experience! I'm glad I'm not into that scene anymore..rough life! We stayed a couple of hours and came on home. The same girlfriend kept the boys overnight on Saturday night and I actually had a free day to myself from about 3:30 that afternoon until I got out of church the next day. Boy, what a good friend. Todd was in Austin this weekend, so I was totally free. I ended up shopping for an hour or so, and came home all excited about watching a good movie on Lifetime, and fell right to sleep. Didn't wake up until 11:00 p.m. Oh well, I enjoyed myself regardless. Talk to you soon! Love ya! Sent: Tuesday, September 18, 2001 8:44 AM You sound good. I'm glad you made it home safely. Here are the numbers: 708-216-8395 (w) 708-386-3558 (h) 630-293-0293 (dad's) yes the wedding was beautiful. I didn't think it was going to happen. Steve literally through a fit when it looked like his family was not going to make it. He wanted to postpone, Nell was concerned about losing money (girl...I was on Steve's side, and could not belief they were worried about the cost of flowers and the cake).......however, Steve has two blessings in his best men. He spoke with them (one from Spokane,WA and the other from Montana. They drove in to Chicago to be with him. 30 hours straight through. He was so happy on Saturday, because they got there in enough time to enjoy the city on Friday. Everything else went off without a hitch, but Karen didn't stop shaking until they cut the cake. (I think she needed a cigarette). Of course Jordan is doing well.....he's a Thurston, with all there good and bad traits.......intellect runs large, conduct however is questionable. I hope Todd quickly sees that making a life together is the big payoff. I'm attaching a special message, that I'll send to Todd separately. One suggestion (if you don't mind), come to an agreement on how to disciple the children. Kids will play you, even at Jordan's age. This will drive a fatal stake in your relationship with Todd. Love, Robyn So good to hear from you! Yes, I did drive back to Houston. I was there on Monday, went to the conference in Lincolnshire, went to dinner Monday night, got up Tuesday, drove to the conference, and all hell broke loose at that point. Total, total chaos, I was so frightened. The group said we're driving back to Houston, once they announced that all airports were closed! 21 Hours to get back, but I Thank God we made it back, and none of us were in harm's way. One of my close co-worker's father just happened to be in New York at the World Trade Center for a meeting that Tuesday, and has been presumed to be dead. It is just a crying shame! Also, the impending war.....did you ever think you would see this in your lifetime? Incidents of this kind really show you that""tomorrow's never promised"". I will be back in the Chicago area real soon, more than likely the first or second week in October. I'm really skeptical about flying, but what do you do? How was the wedding? I know it was beautiful! I'm taking care of myself and living my life. I do what I can, if Todd wants to participate, I'm glad to have him, but if not, me and the boys roll....we can't wait around. Jordan seems to be getting his self together in school, he's received very good conduct grades recently, and the teacher says he at the top of his class, as long as he keeps the conduct grades up to snuff. Talk to you later! Love Patrice P.S.

This approval is based on my understanding that all of this capacity is currently posted, or, if not currently posted, will be posted for the appropriate amount of time prior to sale. Additionally, this approval is contingent on use of the webtext we have been using for other EOL deals (I feel the need to say the obvious because I don't believe Law will see anything on these packages again). I also assume that these will be short term deals--i.e., less than one year. Any long term discounted deals raise concerns that our ""standard discount language"" is designed to address, such as what is the effect of a new rate design or reduction in the max rate on the discounted deal. I think we can live without that language in short term deals for now, but we need to revisit this issue and come up with a solution before we sell any long term deals on EOL. ONe last thing, it is marketing's decision whether to include in the webtext the provision that says Northern gets the $$ if the shipper releases the capacity at a rate higher than the discounted rate. I think our approach in negotiated deals has been to get that agreement if we could (a basis run up could make it a very valuable right). If you have any questions, call me.

Here are the AA's questions: 1) Can you please provide the actual cost for 1999 and the estimated cost for 2000 2) Also, if you have a copy of where these costs are coming from so AA can tie their figures Can you please provide this information today as AA wants to wrap up the notes. Please call me if you have any questions. Thanks again for your help. Aurora",Neutral,2000

There are three worksheets labelled as follows: 'Total Reqs': Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled ""NOM"". The Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at a specific point. The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until further notice. CES schedulers note: the attached file is archived on P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April00\Daily\ .xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate copy elsewhere on the network. 'Daily Change' : shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date. For the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28. Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was in fact effectuated). For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown. (e.g., If today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.) This sheet should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back. The column labelled ""ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume' shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at pre-specified prices. Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be negotiated. 'TCO Storage': Shows the daily swings taken by CES on its (paper) storage injection for the month. Daily swings on TCO storage may be used to meet some or all of the daily swings at delivery points off TCO as shown in the ""Daily Change' worksheet. Omitted pending resolution of TCO storage issues.

Best in Category awards are given for each category of team dance entered, regardless of school size. Klein won best in category for all four team dances entered - kick, pom, military and jazz - a clean sweep. Klein also had the first place winner in the solo category and first place in the duet category. Also won first place in officer dances for super sized schools.

They got a special judges award for Creativity and Originality (commentary on both our fabulous costumes made by a group of Bearkadette moms and the choreography) and a special judges award for Perfect Score (a score of 100 awarded by all 3 judges for a particular routine - apparently very rare).

Sent: Monday, October 22, 2001 3:48 PM Stan, In October we had a plan to purchase 0.5 Bcf of gas that was projected to bring our operational storage level to 12 Bcf by the end of the month and were concerned about over-filling our storage fields from potential long gas by shippers. In reality, prices have risen and shippers have shorted the system by 1.7 Bcf month-to-date. Our original plan, based on a combination of physical requirements and regulatory strategy was as follows: Ending October Balance 12 Bcf Ending November Balance 13 Bcf Ending December Balance 14 Bcf To acheive this plan we are projecting a purchase in November of at least 2.5 Bcf (depending upon shipper short gas over the remainder of the month). We also expect to receive 0.3 Bcf of SBA imbalance payback in November that should raise the operational storage levels to approximately 13 Bcf. We are still at risk for over-filling our storage fields in November and do not wish to buy any volumes that might push us over the 13 Bcf operational storage level. Therefore, we are targeting the purchase of 2.5 Bcf of gas (which may be adjusted based on the customer's imbalances over the next week) for November. Kent",Neutral,2001

(ENE), he threw out a ray of hope for his company's foundering broadband business. Enron Broadband Services had just signed a long-term deal to provide bandwidth for MSN, Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) online Internet service, Skilling said. Enron would give more details on the deal later. After three months without farther word on the deal, Enron has broken its silence by suing Microsoft. In a suit filed Thursday in the district court of Harris County, Texas, Enron claimed Microsoft has failed to live up to terms of the deal. The agreement, signed June 25, called for Enron Broadband to develop and provide network capacity and other services to support Microsoft's offering of high-speed Internet service, according to the lawsuit. Microsoft was required to develop an electronic ordering and billing system for use with all regional Bell telephone companies during an initial phase of the deal, according to the lawsuit. Microsoft has failed to provide that system and other items required in the deal, so Enron isn't required to deliver operational broadband services for the deal, the lawsuit said.",Negative,2001

I just wanted to drop you a line and let you know how I'm doing. My last semester is shaping up to be pretty tough. The MBA class in Real Options is, to say the least, tough! I'm preparing for my mid-term right now, and so far we've learned about Binomial trees, Sharpe ratios, the GOPOP model, risk-neutral pricing, Stochastic Processes, Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo, and pricing American, European, and exotic options. What's also great about the class is that our professor constantly uses Enron as an example of how this stuff works in the real world. It's a great class! One of my other classes, Economic Forecasting, is challenging as well, because I'm dealing with a software package, Eviews, for the first time. Enough about the academics, though; I'm working hard and that's what I need to be doing. I've also started reading Reminiscences, and I find myself highlighting lines on every page! I figured I'd start with the less technical books first, considering my workload. I'm going to be in Houston looking for apartments this weekend, 3/9 - 3/11 with my roommate, Ed Brady, who will also be at Enron in July. Let me know how your schedule looks, and maybe we can get together. Hopefully my getting into your fundamentals group or the new trading rotation that you spoke of is still a high probability. As I'm learning more about options and futures in class, you're definitely right--I think trading is where I want to be! Thanks again and I hope to hear from you soon. I hope all is well in Houston.

Sent: Friday, July 20, 2001 1:21 PM While researching an EOL issue for Upstream Energy Services Company I noticed two records in the Global Counterparty Database that looked to be duplicates. 49992 Upstream Energy Services Company [Tradename] 92260 Upstream Energy Services Company, LLC [Headquarters] Both records are ""active"" (as they should be based on the current classification) However, the note listed below seems to suggest that the customer is actually doing business as LLC: << OLE Object: PBrush >> The only master contract we had in existence was assigned to AEP/HPL and all current business is now conducted under GTCs. BOTH CP versions are EOL counterparties and both appear on the 7/19/01 Credit Watch Report as ""No Trades"" with an E-rating of 10.

Bryce: Does anyone in your group know any reasons why Upstream Energy Services Company, LLC would want to segregate invoices & payments?

How would credit prefer to see this? Stacey/Debra: Are we currently negotiating a replacement GISB with Upstream? If so, any idea which name is or will be on the contract?

Having Bill home with me is a big help and it makes it alot easier for me since we can trade off. Physically, I am feeling almost 100%. I started running a few weeks ago just to keep my sanity and have started playing tennis again although it is going to take a long time for me to get back into playing shape. Arthur is very much into tennis and I am enjoying getting to watch him play. He played in his first tournament over the weekend and did very well. Bill and I are hoping that he keeps it up. He has been great with the baby as I expected. He is a calming influence on him and really interacts well with him. I feel very, very fortunate. How are you doing and how are the boys? I miss work and the interaction with everyone, but at the same time I am enjoying my time at home. I think that you know how I must feel and I'm glad that I still have some time to think about it.

Thank you, Susan Kaspar Integrated Solutions Center Phone 713-345-6008 Cell 713-208-2459 Sent: Tuesday, October 09, 2001 11:04 PM Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world. Some of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personnel) and some are phasing in. While not all of the changes will be visible, there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities. In all the steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of security, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business. Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business controls organization. You can contact this organization through their website (< by phone (713-345-2804), or by email John Brindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization. Please feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, or to report security threats. We have two areas to update you on: changes in the access procedures for the Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory. Access to the Enron Center Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be instituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical): ? As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer. ? Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification). ? Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor card. Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center. ? Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or badged contractor at all times. ? Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron employee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby reception area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointment. At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor. ? Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Security (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to you or hold doors open, allowing ""tail gating"" by others. These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instituted at Enron. We ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby. As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equipment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease. We hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. Travel Advisory Update With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommendations: ? While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommends that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided. We continue to strongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled. In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered. ? For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate security recommends that you carry documentation. There have been several recent reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a result, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the United States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry their passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times. We would also suggest that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card as proof of their status as a precautionary measure. It appears that Immigration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her ""registration"" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanent Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Crossing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers for ""registration"" documentation, but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your current lawful status. We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.",Neutral,2001

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion. Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets. The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations. The pipelines are not being sold. Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line. Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence. We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate. This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

Since we were in the midst of the budgeting process, we wanted their view on the continuation of Doorstep Reviews, and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to Enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues. In reviewing the plans for 4th quarter, one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September 11th terrorists attacks. We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned 4th quarter reviews until early 2002. Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the 4th quarter. Certainly life on October 26 feels different today at Enron than it did on October 3. I understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the additional demands of the budgeting process, and in your case, the voluntary redundancy program. In the next few days I will again review the 4th quarter plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey, sharing with them your concerns. I will let you know the outcome of those conversations. If there is still a strong desire to complete these reviews this year, we will work creatively to leverage work that is being done through the EAS process and minimize both travel and time involved. -Sally Sent: Friday, October 26, 2001 2:24 AM The EAS work takes priority over Doorstep - we need the AA opinion.

One small difference between the two is I am not talking about an equalization between C$ and US$ salaries. Mine is just simply a case of Enron paying under market because they could in the past.

Sent: Friday, January 18, 2002 1:51 PM Zuff Just a quick note after my first look at the numbers. The only concern I have is with the base number. Seeing as there is no money up front, the future payments look a lot more like long term comp. than any real signing or retention bonus. When I came to Enron two years ago I took a $35,000 decrease in base pay in exchange for options and the opportunity to trade for number 1. That is no longer the case (no options and UBS is not #1) therefore I would look for my base to better reflect market on a go forward basis. If you are able to accommodate a reasonable adjustment in base I would be very excited about the opportunity to sign with UBS.

David confirmed that while a New York/Texas court should apply US law for perfection purposes, there is a possibility that a court would say that the law where the pledgor is located would govern perfection. Because of this uncertainty and because of the perfection issues under Canadian law regarding cash collateral, do you all agree that in our masters involving ENA and a Canadian counterparty that Cash is not an acceptable form of collateral? Peter, As I mentioned to you yesterday, with respect to LC's that are issued for our benefit, there could be a circumstance where we would draw and hold the cash as collateral. In that circumstance, I think we need some guidnace from you and Stikeman as to what we should be doing to perfect our interest in such cash. I would be interested in knowing whether in a bankruptcy context involving a Canadian counterparty, whether the court would hold that such cash proceeds are property of the estate.

There is a process that we must follow for software upgrades to ensure compatibility with existing applications and supportability for the helpdesk staff, even if it is for a small subset of the population. Furthermore, all applications must be packaged by Application Integration before it gets rolled out to the desktops. As you can see, it is more than dispatching desktop support to install the application itself. Have you guys look at other technologies such as NetMeeting? It is installed with IE5 and provides real time chat. I don't mean to be a pain in the neck, but I must advise against IE5.5 at this time.

You should be ready to defend your answer. Only a number is allowed, not an algebraic equation. Acquiring a Company In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer), which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of a tender offer. You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares but are unsure how high a price to offer. The main complication is this: the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil exploration project it is currently undertaking. Indeed, the very viability of Company T depends on the exploration outcome. If the project fails, the company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share. But if the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management could be as high as $100/share. All share values between $0 and $100 are considered equally likely. By all estimates, the company will be worth considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management. In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under Company T. If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under either management. If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under current management, the value under Company A is $75/share. Similarly, a $100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company A, and so on. The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the price they should offer for Company T's shares. This offer must be made now, before the outcome of the drilling project is known. From all indications, Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a profitable price. Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the potential of a takeover bid by any other firm. You expect Company T to delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches the press. Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration project when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when deciding whether or not to accept your offer. In addition, Company T will accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of the company under current management. Thus, if you offer $50/share, for instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is anything less than $50. As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price offers in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to $150/share. What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's stock? $ per/share",Neutral,2001

Where does this get us: 1- Sell q3 HU crack and by Q4HO crack (By the time q3 prices out--the wind will have been taken out of HU sails - plus you can do it month avg--therefore less noise) 2-Benefit from heat's recent excitement -- sell HO calls (June -Aug), buy ng puts nov-jan Ng-Disagree: I think prices stay high through June.

I think consensus opinion is that anything under 2.7 TCF is very dangerous entering the winter. A month ago, analysts were predicting we would end the injection season with around 2.6 - 2.7 in the ground. With the most recent AGA, those projections seem to be closer to 2.7. With supply of gas very inelastic to price in the short and medium term, you must look at the demand side of the equation. The market is trying to price out the right amount of demand (mostly through lost industrial load and fuel switching) such that supplies will be stored rather than burned. Each AGA number is another data point as to whether nat gas is high enough to price out enough demand to reach a comfortable level in storage entering the winter. A low AGA number indicates we haven't priced out enough demand and the market must go up. Certainly, the 97 throws a curve in the bull argument, but the number may be a function of very mild weather, a four day holiday weekend, and reporting noise rather than indicative of a structural shift in the supply/demand equilibrium. We'll know a lot more as the next two weeks' numbers come out. If we get two low injections, watch out. Enron North America Corp. cc: John, I think the AGA's are not as important to bulls as to bears. In the beginning of the season, AGA's were very important in framing the bull case. The current expectation is that we will go into the winter under stored. I don't believe any additional AGA news can significantly change that expectation. However, I believe Bears, as evidenced today, will feed more heavily off of bearish AGA news, than bulls will off bullish AGA news. At this juncture, I believe that the most potent bullish news has to come from the physical market and weather. I hope you don't mind me expressing my view point on this issue.

After a great F, had an okay G. Held a lot of term length on the risk/reward play. Figured if we got no weather, all the customer and generator buying would be my stop. It was. Amazing that for the drop in price in H, the strips have really gone nowhere. just a big chop fest. i here your arguments, but think they are way exagerated. Agree with 1.5-2 bcf/d more supply. Call it 2 with LNG. Imports from Canada should be negligible. Now let's assume price for the summer is $4. No switching, full liquids extraction, methanol and fertilizer running. Electric generation demand, considering problems in west and very low hydro, around 1.5 bcf/d greater this year with normal weather. Means you have to price 2 bcf/d out of market. Don't think $4 does that. What level did we start really losing demand last year? It was higher than 4. concerned about recession in industrial sector thats occuring right now. Think gas is fairly valued here. Dont think we're going to 7. But I think fear of market considering what happened this past year will keep forward curve very well supported through spring. we're already into storage economics so the front goes where the forward curve wants to go. on 02/26/2001 04:48:06 PM cc: its been a while-hope all is well. not a great few weeks for me in ngas-not awful just nothing really working for me and as you know got in front of march/apr a cupla times, no disasters. well im bearish-i hate to be so after a 4 buck drop but as i said a month ago to you-and now pira coming around. 5.00 gas is a disaster for the natgas demand. now production up strongly y on y...you guys agree on the production side? i know youve been bullish the summer-think im stll in the minority-but here you go, we have y on y supplly up 2/bcf+ demnad loss 3.5bcf/d, 5.5 bcf/day y on y swing . then i submit as we started to see due huge rate increases R/C demandd energy conservation will be even more dramatic this summer which will effect utilty demand/power demand ulitmately. if pira rite we lost 1.56 in jan for this factor i say it cud be bigger this summer as ute loads increase, power pxes rise and consumers become poorer. there will be more demand flexibilty in the summer part in the midcon and north as AC is more of a luxury item than heat. i say 5-6% lower use in residentail/utilty power consumption due rationing is another .7/1bcf/d loss. put all this together we wud build an addional 1284 apr thru oct on top of last years 1715 build basis last year temps and todays prices. takes us to 3.6 tcf or so. what am i missing my man-summer has to go to 4 bucks or lower to restore demand??? thots. as far as that other thing, the p&c its still alive, shud know more soon and ill keep you posted.",Neutral,2001

This standard, long in the making, provides an opportunity for economic developers and their customers to have one common means of presenting and examining data. Adoption of the standard promises real time savings and more effective economic development decisions as communities will be more comparable than ever before. A copy of the standards is attached so that you can take a look at it to see how the data standards can be made to work for you. There are 25 tables in the standard presented in an excel format. The tabs at the bottom of the page will access the additional tables. You can assemble your own data for the data standard tables or you can use the services of ACN, the American Community Network. AEDC has entered into a strategic partnership with ACN to provide much of the data necessary for the standards. ACN will provide data and provide future updates of the standard to AEDC members at a discounted rate. It is your call as to which approach works best for you. Adoption of the standards promises great changes for the economic development profession. They should be of particular advantage to the many areas that have great economic development opportunities but which haven't received the consideration they deserve. The standards are a great way to tell their story. If you'd like more information on the use of the standards, look for notices of upcoming courses offered with AEDC's National Seminars on the standards and their use.

It may have to do with how you shaped the forward vol and price curves at each level. My VAR is so dependent on spread levels and vols that a small change in the Jan vols could produce that effect. The results certainly provide evidence of a need for higher VAR going into the winter. John Enron North America Corp. cc: Vladimir Sunil The below file shows the results of the two stress test requested. Under the $7 dollar stress, NYMEX curve was shifted to $7 dollars with all other price curves proportionally shifted. Under the $9 dollar test, not only were the price curves shifted, but volatilites were stressed as well with NYMEX volatility going to 100% and all other vol locations being raised accordingly. Key findings include: $7 dollar stress only raised VaR by 79% $9 dollar stress raised VaR by 134% It is interesting to note that with the seven dollar stress, VaR on the financial desk actually decreased. This would seem to imply that up to the seven dollar strike, the financial desk is long gamma (which overall reduces risk).

Obviously the most important aspect of lng is how much gas is coming in, what is that relative to last year, and what new capacity is coming longer term. As an aside, nat gas trades as a funciton of the storage spread to last year and five year averages. It would be very useful if all fundamental analysis were geared the same way. The fact that lng shipments are x this week is meaningless. the fact that they are y delta of last year is extremely useful. if you noticed in the fundies meeting, i was trying to move discussion that way. what's switching vis a vis last year. whats production relative to last year. it simplifies the fundamental analysis. cc: An initial effort--please comment << File: LNG20010312.pdf >>",Negative,2001

My short-term market patterns suggested a more robust price rally and natural appears to be waning at present. Volume on this rally is poor, particularly since yesterday was a decent day to the upside. The market appears to be using a lot of its energy but spinning its wheels. If we are at these same price levels in another two weeks, that would be extremely bullish. Right here, the risk/reward to being long is not so great. Recommend a neutral stance short-term on natural. Bigger picture is still very bullish. However, this market needs another 1-2 weeks of what I would call horizontal price action to set the stage for a big move to the upside. Let me know if this stuff is useful for you. I certainly don't want to waste your time. In addition, if you prefer I call when I have something to pass along, let me know. I don't know how often you check/see your e-mail.

You should be ready to defend your answer. Only a number is allowed, not an algebraic equation. Acquiring a Company In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer), which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of a tender offer. You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares but are unsure how high a price to offer. The main complication is this: the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil exploration project it is currently undertaking. Indeed, the very viability of Company T depends on the exploration outcome. If the project fails, the company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share. But if the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management could be as high as $100/share. All share values between $0 and $100 are considered equally likely. By all estimates, the company will be worth considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management. In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under Company T. If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under either management. If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under current management, the value under Company A is $75/share. Similarly, a $100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company A, and so on. The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the price they should offer for Company T's shares. This offer must be made now, before the outcome of the drilling project is known. From all indications, Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a profitable price. Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the potential of a takeover bid by any other firm. You expect Company T to delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches the press. Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration project when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when deciding whether or not to accept your offer. In addition, Company T will accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of the company under current management. Thus, if you offer $50/share, for instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is anything less than $50.

PaineWebber knows affluent investors such as yourself want access to alternative investments such as private equity and hedge funds. Our group has also found that high net worth individuals prefer a consultative relationship where we help you structure a complete asset allocation based on your objectives. We then provide you with access to, and help you select, third-party institutional money managers to make the day-to-day investment decisions. We also provide the ongoing performance monitoring of those managers, including correlations to the appropriate indices. I believe you will find our approach to be appreciably different from your previous contacts with financial advisors, where you have felt the advisor was 'pushing' a house fund or stock du jour. If your schedule permits, I would like to meet with you on Thursday afternoon to discuss this in more detail. How does 4 PM sound? - Mike Sent: Saturday, February 24, 2001 10:41 AM Michael: Thanks for putting the paperwork together. I would have interest in meeting if you can present unique investment opportunities that I don't have access to now. Most of my contact with financial advisors in the past has consisted of them suggesting a mutual fund, telling me to invest in Home Depot, Sun, and Coke, or trying to pass off their banks' biased research reports as something valuable. The above services provide no value to me personally. If you can present opportunities such as access to private equity or hedge funds, or other ideas with strong growth potential and low correlation to the I'd listen.

Apparently I missed a little craziness. My point on v/x is that forward spreads, months 3/4 and back, don't necessarily trade on value, they trade on drawing a forward curve that makes equilibrium between hedging and spec demand. Look at k/m... do you think k cash will average 3 cents above m. i don't really see that scenario. yet that's what it is worth because the market says jv is worth $x and to get there k/m=3. The same argument applies to v/x. i think this summer will be exceptionally strong as we try to inject 2 bcf/d more gas than last year. But cal 2 will lag the move. It's the main thing customers are selling right now because every equity analyst and even Pira are telling their customers that cal 2 will average 3.50. so either the v/x and x/z spreads come in or f/g g/h h/j blow out. After this winter, who in there right mind wants to buy f/g or g/h again. my thought is that the primary juice will be h/j but v/x and x/z will be under some pressure. i'm a seller at 9 and buyer at 5-6. Not much in it either way though. on 01/31/2001 04:47:22 PM cc: you got me wrong-i wanna sell oct buy nov forward. look-two scenarios med longer term. we inject like mad early summer-economy stays crappy the frot of the curve gets slaughtered.-oct/nov goes to 3 cts sometime between now and end sep scenario 2-they dont enject what they want-oct /nov wil stay tite between say 3-and 10 cts like this year but man after this winter they will panic at some point and buy the hell out of the winter strip and blow out oct /nov to 30 cts cuz they panic. to me if that one was to ever backwardate it was this summer-low low stx and injections and they still blew out cuz they panicked about winter-as we see this winter now for good reason..?? capeche? i thinkit a win win you still in the damn mar/apr-i only sold a little prenumber-cant beleive how this got killed after-what changed?? from 1:30 to 2:05 on 01/31/2001 05:41:45 PM cc: Fax to: quit pressuring them i want to sell some too. actually sold a few at 9 on the close on 01/31/2001 12:40:07 PM cc: i hate hate that sprd-at 8 cts i think its such a good bearsprd-hope it keeps coming in. ill tell you why later",Negative,2001

Weather a little cooler for this week. Overall normal for 6-10. JV up 12 cents. Think just as customers got totally fucked last year selling into the rally, they are going to buy all the way down. Differnence is last year trade very happy to take in all the length. This year trade not ready to get really short. Not until healthy inj in April anyways. I think money from here will be made being short, just question of what and when. Think there'll be enough hedging demand to keep curve very strong unless phys market just totally rejects price level. With amount of inj capacity available, hard to believe phys market is going to dictate prices for next couple months. I think it will be spec and hedgers dictating. Spec staying on sidelines right now and hedgers buying. Leads to more upside potential in short term. My point in V/X was that jv would be strong and cal2 hedging was from sell side leading to pressure on those spreads. The california term power sales have totally changed that. Before, the only thing customers were selling was cal 2. Now, customer interest much more from buyside in cal 2,3 solely from california. Now turning neutral v/x and x/z. You have very valid points. i like q/v more though. I think you could have 10 cents of upside in that with little downside. Thoughts?",Positive,2001

Then it saw a better deal. With California desperate for power and electricity prices hitting unheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week. It is selling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what it pays Bonneville under long-standing contracts. It is a measure of this winter's fuel crunch: Some big industrial firms in energy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and even oil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity or natural gas than manufacturing their products. The shifts by such large industrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts -- will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter. But they also are sowing seeds of potential problems next year. Shortages of aluminum and fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt to consumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said. ""The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don't know what they're going to use to grow crops with,"" said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's. Some economists have recently increased their warnings about the damaging impact of this winter's heating bills on an already weakening economy. Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimated that gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1,000 for a typical U.S. household. That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higher energy costs compared with a year ago, they estimated, cutting the expected growth in the nation's economic output by one percentage point on an annual rate in the first three months of next year. ""Overall, the recent energy price developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economic slowdown,"" the Goldman Sachs report concluded. Terra Industries Inc., in Sioux City, Iowa, has closed three of its six U.S. ammonia plants, which use natural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production. Like Kaiser, the company realized it would be much more profitable to stop production in December and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices, which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under its existing December supply contract, said Mark Rosenbury, chief administrative officer. ""We looked at these [current] prices and said, 'This is crazy,' "" he said. Terra hasn't disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas, but Rosenbury said it would be ""substantial."" In coming months, Terra's good fortune could be reversed. It usually buys gas a month at a time, and the prices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break-even point. That would keep Terra's plants closed, Rosenbury said, but eliminate the opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit. ""If this persists,"" Rosenbury said, ""it's going to be a real problem."" He estimates that out of a total annual U.S. production capacity of 18 million tons of ammonia, about 4 million tons of production isn't operating now. ""Could we be short of fertilizer next spring? It's possible that farmers will not have as much as they want,"" Rosenbury said. Royster-Clark Inc., a Norfolk and New York City-based fertilizer manufacturer and distributor, has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque, Ill., indefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning next month. The story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justify continued production. ""We believe it's likely this is a speculative bubble [in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we'll be able to buy gas at a more reasonable price, but that remains to be seen,"" said Paul M. Murphy, the company's managing director for financial planning. A continuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production and raise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers' decisions to plant feed corn, he said. ""It's sticker shock."" According to Wyss, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gas remains above $7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago -- farm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002. In the aluminum industry, several smaller producers have joined Kaiser, the industry's No. 2 manufacturer, in closing down, noted Lloyd O'Carroll, an analyst with BB&T Capital Markets in Richmond. Aluminum production in November was 8.3 percent below that of November 1999, and December's production will be lower still, he said. ""We'll get more production cut announcements, I think,"" he said. A slowing in the U.S. and world economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminum supplies. ""But if the world economy doesn't fall completely apart, then [aluminum] prices are going to rise, and they could rise significantly more than the current forecast,"" he said. In Kaiser's case, it's an open question how much of its electric windfall it will keep. Kaiser is contractually entitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at $22.50 a megawatt per hour, says spokesman Scott Lamb. That is the power it has sold back to Bonneville for $550 a megawatt hour for December. But the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and future profits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants, to invest in new electric generating capacity, or even to refund to Bonneville's other customers, said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey. Kaiser and Bonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect after next October, but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveries to Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits. ""Out here, a deal is a deal, but it has to be a moral deal. There has to be an ethical dimension to this and we're not shy in trying to make sure they live up their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power,"" Mosey said. , 2000 The Washington Post Company",Negative,2000

Optimally, I think we want to offer a minimum size of 100 across all strikes. If the swap is 4/4.5, one a day up, and someone buys half a day, making the market, 4/4.5 one a day by half a day, the size offered on a 10 cent out of the money call might be as low as 30 contracts, a much smaller size than most people want to trade. If we restrict to strikes with a lower delta, we face the problem of not offering enough strikes and not making a market in options that have open EOL interest that have moved closer to the money. Maybe the answer is to assume the swap hedge to be a penny wide two way wrapped around the EOL swap mid market. Thus if the front swap on EOL is 4/4.5 one a day by half a day, the input into the option calculator is 3.75/4.75, 100 up. In this case I think 100 is necessary because once a strike has open interest, we must continue to support it. Thus I anticipate having to make markets in deep itm options as the market moves. In terms of straddle strikes, I think the edge received from buying straddles struck on the EOL offer and vice-versa is not big enough to compensate for what I think the industry will view as a scam and another way Enron is trying to rip people off. Although striking on the mid-market is probably easier for the trader, I actually think striking in five cent increments makes more sense. It allows people to trade out of the position on EOL. Whereas if someone buys the 3085 straddle and the market moves to 3200, they have to call ENE to close the trade. If the trade is struck at 3100, we will have a market on both the 3100 call and put at all times. Secondly, I would anticipate non-volatility driven option traders may elect to sell either just the put or call in this scenario depending on their view of market direction.",Neutral,2000

In such a circumstance, cash may separate from prompt futures similar to how Midwest power traded $5000+ on specific days last year while prompt futures were $200. The correlation between prompt and cash is normally very strong, and is indicated by the small VAR associated with a spread position currently. But in the winter that may change. Another thing to keep in mind while developing this scenario is the assymetric risk presented by having a spread position on. Assuming we enter the winter with normal to below normal storage levels, a position of long cash, short prompt futures has a long tail only on the positive p&l side. While such a trade in an efficient market has expected payout of 0, the payout probabilities may look like the following: 20% $ -.05 40% $ -.02 20% $ 0 19% $ .03 1% $ 1 Enron North America Corp. cc: RAC is working on developing some ""canned"" stress tests regarding VaR.

Our analysis is saying: gas at 2.50 we would have had 4.5 bcf a day more demand. that includes commercial residential industrial switching processing... as far as 2 bcf/d power gen demand- that counts the fact that last year was extremely mild versus expectation of normal summer this year, west will be running every gas unit virtually all hours as power demand is growing maybe 5% still and hydro way down. every molecule that can will flow west from waha this summer versus little last year. east power prices really havent reached point of priceing out demand and heat rates healthy enough to where gas can go up without raising power prices to cut demand. some concern of more efficient replacing less but hard to quantify. we're trying to build the stack now to estimate. frac margins now positive for all but most inefficient processors. will continue coming back. a little concerned about 2 oil prices. bordering right there now for places like florida and actually saw fl demand rise 100,000 last week as gas got to parity. let me look into inj capability. definitely bigger when field is empty from engineering standpoint so any problems really wont arise until fall when gen demand low and inj capacity lower...my initial thoughts. bo seems as neutral as everyone else in the market right now. really inactive. to clarify, not raging bull. i like everybody want to see what the inj numbers in april look like. nobody putting a position on until that starts to clarify. just think that hedging demand is making market a little short right now making next move up more likely. would be scale up seller though not really sure why cash trades at 10-15 back. doesnt make any sense. however as more fields start turning around throughout month, the stg arb to great in my opinion to keep spread there. must close one way or the other. notice that spread tightened to 6-8 towards end of trading friday? in general think that gas is reaching the elasticity stage right here. 50 cents lower and no switching, no processing, and gain back some demand. market needs to see some big stg numbers first. i think the best play right now is to start buying longer term put spreads.

Apparently I missed a little craziness. My point on v/x is that forward spreads, months 3/4 and back, don't necessarily trade on value, they trade on drawing a forward curve that makes equilibrium between hedging and spec demand. Look at k/m... do you think k cash will average 3 cents above m. i don't really see that scenario. yet that's what it is worth because the market says jv is worth $x and to get there k/m=3. The same argument applies to v/x. i think this summer will be exceptionally strong as we try to inject 2 bcf/d more gas than last year. But cal 2 will lag the move. It's the main thing customers are selling right now because every equity analyst and even Pira are telling their customers that cal 2 will average 3.50. so either the v/x and x/z spreads come in or f/g g/h h/j blow out. After this winter, who in there right mind wants to buy f/g or g/h again. my thought is that the primary juice will be h/j but v/x and x/z will be under some pressure. i'm a seller at 9 and buyer at 5-6. Not much in it either way though. on 01/31/2001 04:47:22 PM cc: you got me wrong-i wanna sell oct buy nov forward. look-two scenarios med longer term. we inject like mad early summer-economy stays crappy the frot of the curve gets slaughtered.-oct/nov goes to 3 cts sometime between now and end sep scenario 2-they dont enject what they want-oct /nov wil stay tite between say 3-and 10 cts like this year but man after this winter they will panic at some point and buy the hell out of the winter strip and blow out oct /nov to 30 cts cuz they panic. to me if that one was to ever backwardate it was this summer-low low stx and injections and they still blew out cuz they panicked about winter-as we see this winter now for good reason..?? capeche? i thinkit a win win you still in the damn mar/apr-i only sold a little prenumber-cant beleive how this got killed after-what changed?? from 1:30 to 2:05 on 01/31/2001 05:41:45 PM cc: Fax to: quit pressuring them i want to sell some too. actually sold a few at 9 on the close on 01/31/2001 12:40:07 PM cc: i hate hate that sprd-at 8 cts i think its such a good bearsprd-hope it keeps coming in. ill tell you why later",Neutral,2001

Vince J Kaminski 06/01/2000 09:19 AM cc: Vince J Tanya Jim Jeffrey A John, We have been working for the last few days on VaR related issues. The focus is on Jim Schwieger's storage book as of 5/25 and 5/26 where we had some counterintuitive results. This book is a good candidate for a systematic review of the VaR process. It seems that the problem arises from forward - forward vols used by the VaR system. You can see in the attached spreadsheet that the VaR, on a cumulative basis, jumps on Jan 04, when an abnormal FF vol hits a relatively large position. This FF vol is also much different from the previous day number producing a big jump in VaR. This row (Jan 04) is in magenta font in the attached spreadsheet. Please, look at column D. The abnormal FF vol may result from one of the two factors: a. a bug in the code. We are working with the person in IT who wrote the code to review it. b. a poorly conditioned forward vol curve ( a kink or discontinuity in the fwd vol curve will do it). One solution I can propose, is to develop for the traders a fwd-fwd vol generator allowing them to review the fwd vol curve before it is posted. If it produces a weird fwd-fwd vol, it can be smoothed. Can you meet at 4 p.m. to review our findings? Vince",Neutral,2000

Regards, Gary x31511 John Arnold 10/08/2000 02:05 PM cc: I can do it either way but would much rather just make it the simple average of prices, 5 per week. cc: John(s), How will the Asian options we purchased from the gas desk settle with respect to weekends... will the average of every day's gas daily settle mean the average of only the days on which Gas Daily is published? or will it triple count each Friday's or Monday's price to account for the weekend (with a similar calculation on weekends). I assume it is the former, not the latter. Is this correct? Are you indifferent if we want to switch to the latter? Intuitively, it would seem to me that at this point, it wouldn't matter (because Friday or Monday prices are just as likely to be above the average as below the average), but you're wearing the risk, not us - so let me know. Frankly, we don't have a preference as a desk, except that we need the settlement to be consistent with the deal we are entering into with SMUD.

There are convincing arguments as to why the summer/winter spreads should tighten over time. However, in the previous methodology they blew out. For instance summer/winter in Cal 3 was .232 while Cal 10 was .256. I have added a seasonality dampening function that both contracts the summer/winter spread and applies a premium to the electric load demand months of July and August over time. The formula for the curve remains the same except for a premium lookup for the month as well as for the year. These premiums are as follows: Jan -.008 Feb -.004 Mar -.001 Apr .002 May .003 Jun .004 Jul .004 Aug .004 Sep .003 Oct .002 Nov -.003 Dec -.006 These premiums start in Jan 2004 On Wednesday Jan 2003 settled 2.959, the 3/4 spread was marked at .0375, the 4/5 spread was marked at .0475. In the old methodology Jan 2003 = 2.959 Jan 2004 = 2.959 + .0375 = 2.9965 Jan 2005 = 2.9965 + .0475 = 3.044 In the new methodology Jan 2003 = 2.959 Jan 2004 = 2.959 + .0375 - .008 =2.9885 Jan 2005 = 2.9885 + .0475 -.008 = 3.028 The only change in the formula is from: Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table to Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table + lookup on month premium table The seasonality premiums will change over time and I will let you know when I change them",Neutral,2000

If they shop the deal, everyone will front-run the volumes and they won't get a good price on the deal. Financial deals settle 5 days after the index has been published. Physical deals settle much later. My understanding is this is a financial deal. cc: Per Caroline John Sara William S The New York office has been speaking to Credit Suisse First Boston for roughly 6 months about a producer hedging deal that is part of a strucutured deal they're putting together. It now looks as if it will get done in the next 3 weeks-1 month so we want to get all the necessary credit issues taken care of. In brief, the deal is a fixed price one, basis TCO (67% of the volumes) and CNG (33%) with a fixed price Nymex component as well. It will settle against the Inside FERC indices for both locations. The term of the deal is from December, 2000 to December 2012. The volumes decline throughout the term from roughly 22,000 mmBtu/d to 13,000 mmBtu/d. The average daily nominal volume is 17,000 mmBtu/d. As I understand it, these volumes are about 65% of the producers' total volumes. I've attached a spreadsheet to this message with more details. There are a couple of contractual and credit issues that CSFB wants to clarify. First, there is a question of the monthly cash settlement. CSFB would like payment to take place on the fifteenth of the month following the date both the floating and fixed prices are known. As I understand it, for the December settlement, which would be known in early December, cash payment would take place on February 15, 2000. Second, there is a question of a parent guarantee from Enron Corp. Apparently, there is an existing credit arrangement in place between ENA and Credit Suisse First Boston International - the same counterparty that we would be dealing with here - that has a $15 million guarantee from Enron Corp. CSFB would like to increase this guarantee to at least $100 million. (CSFB already has an unlimited guarantee from Enron Corp. for a deal they've done with us in Europe so in their opinion it should not be an issue). There is another minor issue involving centralizing credit discussions with the aim of securing a similar credit arrangement for CSFB's dealings with EnronCredit.com - which may be an issue for London rather than Houston. However, CSFB agreed that this was a secondary issue in relation to this transaction. CSFB would like to do the entire deal through us, rather than having to split it among one or more counterparties. Per, Caroline Abramo, and I are meeting with Paul tomorrow to discuss various credit issues, including this one. Ideally, CSFB would like to have a good idea of where they stand by the end of this week. Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions. Regards, Russ",Positive,2000

Where does this get us: 1- Sell q3 HU crack and by Q4HO crack (By the time q3 prices out--the wind will have been taken out of HU sails - plus you can do it month avg--therefore less noise) 2-Benefit from heat's recent excitement -- sell HO calls (June -Aug), buy ng puts nov-jan Ng-Disagree: I think prices stay high through June.

There continue to be a proliferation of new systems coming online in the US; two more start in the next two months. We are pretty close to finalizing a plan to open our system to everyone in terms of accepting limit orders and posting best bid/offer regardless of whose it is. In this framework, Enron would sleeve credit for free should two third parties be matched on our system. However, we would hold the book, getting to see what everyone was doing at all times. The idea is that if we can move the industry's order flow from 30-40% EOL to 60% EOL, we get a huge information advantage in addition to a couple trading advantages, namely we have first priority on all numbers even if we are joining a limit bid posted by a counterparty before us and second, we posess a proprietary stack manager that will allow us to transact on attractive limit orders faster than our competitors. Still working on technical issues. The decision to open EOL markets would be done on a product by product basis. Give me a call if you want to discuss.

Once again, thanks for your help All the best, Andy John Arnold 21/02/2001 04:26 cc: Andy: Enjoyed meeting with you. One more thing I did not address. My ultimate goal is to move all volume to EOL. However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viable electronic trading systems. We make it a point to never support these if possible. We will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greater than our bid. For instance, if we are 6/8 but have a strong inclination to buy and another system is at 7, I will simultaneously lift their 7's and move my market to 7/9. The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the trade if I'm bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade to him. People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other systems because they will just get picked off. If they don't post numbers on the other systems, the systems get no liquidity and die. I mention this because I have heard that Enron is a fairly large trader on Spectron's system. I don't know whether it is in regards to gas, power, or metals. Just something to think about and maybe talk about with the other traders.

Whalley had similar thoughts about how to address the ICE issue. His thoughts are that if we are 4/5 on EOL, we post 1/8 on ICE. If someone betters the bid to 1.5, a logic server automatically bumps up our bid to 1.75. If someone betters that to 2 bid, we immediately go 2.25 bid. So we are always the best market on ICE so long as it is not inside our EOL 2-way. Thus the only way our best market shows on ICE is if without us the market is 3.75/5.25, at which point our 4/5 market gets shown. If the 3.75 bid pulls out, so does our 4 bid. Our proposal was that if EOL was 4/5 we would always show ICE 3.75/5.25. Think about which system you like better. Whalley loved Fletch's idea of running tally of brokerage saved and that will be implemented shortly. I am going to call another EOL meeting for everyone on the gas floor managing a product this week. The purpose will be to communicate about the importance of winning the electronic commerce game through a combination of improving 2-ways and killing the broker markets.",Positive,2000

The price level was $9. Of course there is a lag. Let's make up a lag time...say one month. On Dec 1 cash was trading $6.70. Probably a similar lag on the way down. Cash is $5.20 today. How much lost demand will there be in a month if we're still $5.2? million dollar question if you can answer that. on 02/27/2001 08:12:32 PM cc: off the cuff i wud say tho same goes for 5.00 gas-currently 6-7 bcf/day swing y on y too much, to buy this level you need to take the view that industrial america and residential and end users will be able to get back on their feet and recocover a lion share of the 4-4.5 bcf/d demand destruction(this assumes as current. very little if any dist fuel switching. i think the answer is no-not unless the economy was jump starter quickly-2nd q is gone,so maybe th 4q. remember the demand destruction and industrial shit really just started only 6 weeks ago-me thinks it will take longer than that to get back into full swing. we all trade the y on y gap...all things remaining equal(ie term px for the summer), starting april we'll have a surplus the other way by july barring a greenhouse in the ohio valley good to hear your view pt as always-even if it is wrong!!! ha on 02/27/2001 08:23:22 PM cc: Fax to: Good to hear from you. After a great F, had an okay G. Held a lot of term length on the risk/reward play. Figured if we got no weather, all the customer and generator buying would be my stop. It was. Amazing that for the drop in price in H, the strips have really gone nowhere. just a big chop fest. i here your arguments, but think they are way exagerated. Agree with 1.5-2 bcf/d more supply. Call it 2 with LNG. Imports from Canada should be negligible. Now let's assume price for the summer is $4. No switching, full liquids extraction, methanol and fertilizer running. Electric generation demand, considering problems in west and very low hydro, around 1.5 bcf/d greater this year with normal weather. Means you have to price 2 bcf/d out of market. Don't think $4 does that. What level did we start really losing demand last year? It was higher than 4. concerned about recession in industrial sector thats occuring right now. Think gas is fairly valued here. Dont think we're going to 7. But I think fear of market considering what happened this past year will keep forward curve very well supported through spring. we're already into storage economics so the front goes where the forward curve wants to go. on 02/26/2001 04:48:06 PM cc: its been a while-hope all is well. not a great few weeks for me in ngas-not awful just nothing really working for me and as you know got in front of march/apr a cupla times, no disasters. well im bearish-i hate to be so after a 4 buck drop but as i said a month ago to you-and now pira coming around. 5.00 gas is a disaster for the natgas demand. now production up strongly y on y...you guys agree on the production side? i know youve been bullish the summer-think im stll in the minority-but here you go, we have y on y supplly up 2/bcf+ demnad loss 3.5bcf/d, 5.5 bcf/day y on y swing . then i submit as we started to see due huge rate increases R/C demandd energy conservation will be even more dramatic this summer which will effect utilty demand/power demand ulitmately. if pira rite we lost 1.56 in jan for this factor i say it cud be bigger this summer as ute loads increase, power pxes rise and consumers become poorer. there will be more demand flexibilty in the summer part in the midcon and north as AC is more of a luxury item than heat. i say 5-6% lower use in residentail/utilty power consumption due rationing is another .7/1bcf/d loss. put all this together we wud build an addional 1284 apr thru oct on top of last years 1715 build basis last year temps and todays prices. takes us to 3.6 tcf or so. what am i missing my man-summer has to go to 4 bucks or lower to restore demand??? thots. as far as that other thing, the p&c its still alive, shud know more soon and ill keep you posted.",Negative,2001

He reviewed why historically everyone looks to germany (i.e. Bubba) as a proxy for determining monetary policy in Europe. Moreover, he explained why exchange rates were the focal point in determining monetary policy in Germany. With the new ECB, the bank heads are explicitly trying to remove public focus on exchange rates. However, this effort may have led to the belief by the financial community that the ECB does not care about/ will not defend the euro. He then stated that this is not true.

And are you calling me wacky?? =) Basically, I just started working for a new-ish hedge fund in Boston with Chuck Clough, the former Chief Investment Strategist for Merrill. I got a random phone call yesterday from a woman who is just starting a hedge fund here in Boston. She had heard I was in town and has been trying to get a hold of me to help her start her hedge fund. She finally got my number from someone, who told her I had already started working with Chuck. I'm not sure why she called me anyway, but she basically tried to convince me what a great opportunity it would be to work with her and her ""team."" The only person on her ""team"" that she described was Jeff Gossett. She said that she and her husband had hired him out of Southwest Texas undergrad and he had stayed with her first fund for four years (which she subsequently sold) until Enron recruited him away. The stories of the recruitment seemed a bit wild, like using private jets to fly him to Europe. Anyway, she said that he had quit Enron two weeks ago to join her in this new hedge fund. Having never heard of him and thinking she seemed to be a bit of a crackpot, I was wondering if it was true. I would never leave this opportunity, even if she offered me the world, but I have friends who really want to break into hedge funds, so I was doing some due diligence on their behalf.

Sent: Tue 10/16/2001 11:03 PM Thanks. Surprised your shorts are still so confident. Trade shorts are quickly losing confidence based upon cash, shape of curve, and momentum. I think curve flattens a little more and then comes down in parallel shift down. 1. jan and feb are highest storage adjusted prices on curve. For market area sales, add on basis and dec and march are next. Question is whether there is enough non-discretionary stg to meet load at other times and in the producing region. A lot of stg has to come out either for tariff or engineering reasons. Million dollar question. 2. Think Nov bidweek will be weak. Don't know who baseload buyers are unless trade gets bullish. Nov is a relatively flat month as far as injections. stg operators dont have room to buy baseload gas and I think utilities will be planning to meet load using stg. At current prices, producers apply more pressure to wells, lng doesnt get diverted again, lose some load to resid, lose any momentum of industrial load coming back. Dont think gas market can handle that. 3. No clue.

(wwwowe.water.ca.gov).. nothing too illuminating except that their power costs have come down from over $300 in march to$45 this month but due to the nature the borrowing costs associated with the LT contracts, they will not be able to pass on much savings to consumers (gotta love that). we were supposed to have received a copy of all their LT purchases in July. checking what happened there. we know that there were 54 contracts signed .. half linked to gas which covered 1/3 of cali's total needs (looks like for 10 years). some left open the possibility of the state procuring gas supplies for the plants.. dwr has signed 6 agreements w/ gas suppliers..pretty sure cali uses 25,000-45,000 MW per year which is about 70 contracts a day in gas terms. If they locked in 1/3.. it would be about 25/day.. the deal they just did was about 16/day for just cal02..probably waiting for curve to flatten further to do more.. they purchased another 500 MW in Aug - the 17th (all 10-12 years)..and to date it looks like they have not purchased anything (have been selling into the grid daily) but not liquidating any previously negotiated LT deals (LT is anything beyond 3 months). it sounds like they are planning on buying more of their gas requirements.. Sempra (who has LT power contracts with DWR and gives them the ability to buy 80% of their gas) said DWR had not purchased any gas yet. Pls note story on page 5 & 6 of todays gas daily... mentions California Dept of Water looking to hedge gas purchases for long-term contracts. over the past few days we have seen Major Inv. Bk Buying Cal 02 Nymex Calls and the same bank buying Cal 02 Socal basis calls - very good size This, we believe, is a hedge for this DWR story. The article mentions that they were ""looking at ways to expand its gas purchases"". The article does not mention, nor do we know, how far out they are looking to purchase. Socal basis has moved on the back of this deal....

We are in the process of drawing up a term sheet and proposing a financial structure. We have set a meeting for Nov 12 in NYC to get into the details of financial terms and structure. The deal is going well and we are working with the following hi-level parameters: Initially 8 Nymex look-a-like-products: Natural Gas (prompt, prompt+1, prompt+2), WTI (prompt), Gasoline (prompt, prompt+1), Heating Oil (prompt, prompt+1) 2 customer buckets with different spreads and volumes: Institutional and Retail Volumes for Institutional will be 1 contract moving towards 0.5 contract and 0.2 contract possibly to match Nymex mini concept, Volumes for retail will be 0.5 contracts moving to 0.2 contract to match Nymex mini concept Data feed with price and volumes sent from EnronOnline to Refco system customized and powered by EnronOnline software Initially target scope is designed for a capacity of 5000 customers, 500 simultaneous Refco will take credit risk for their customers and post daily collateral with Enron Refco will pay Enron a one-time license fee for a 3 year contract with an additional annual maintenance & support fee Enron will keep all additional margin generated by the transactions and Refco will keep the commissions generated and float from additional margin held. Obviously, the above parameters are the preliminary thoughts and subject to change and negotiation. We are just beginning to model the potential revenue and cost streams and there will likely be some adjustments that will come out of this exercise. There are also a number of alternative technology scenarios to pursue if we have more or less money to work with. Please feel free to call me x36413 if you have any questions or comments.

Sent: Tuesday, September 25, 2001 10:43 PM Hi- thought you'd want to know some of the recent equity comments from a few of the funds. Bad comments first.. ENE: Ospraie, one of the Tudor funds has actually been reducing all their trading exposure to us becuase of our ""credit situation"". At one point they probably had a 12,000 contract short gas position with us where we might have 1000 lots on now. They have studied our financials for the last 2 years and like the rest of wall street can not determine how to value us.. I think the bigger concern though is our credit line situation. Its been leaked that the availability of our borrowing is linked to stock price.. obviously the street does not know the real details but the fact these rumors are out there and lack of statements by us to the contrary are causing some to panic. I've heard the same come out of SAC which is a 5 B equity shop who also put on the favorite short-ENE. SAC has just started trading with us. I am not sure what to do about this.. luckily Ospraie is the only group commenting on our credit. I am not having any problems YET with any of the banks except CSFB- and thats not new.. I have not been able to trade with them for the last year. I am anticipating problems which is why I am trying to work out a clearing system in the interim. I am sure Ken will do a better job of putting some of these fears to rest.. and the street will be able to assign us a PE in line with other trading companies (8-10) plus some growth component (5) for developing businesses. And at $20, they reckon we get taken out anyway.. the fact remains that Enron has major franchise value. Good news- Ospraie covered their short at $30 when PGE resiolution came out Thursday and we rallied $4. Other comments from Catequil.. they generally think a lot of the energy sector (E+Ps) are close to bottom. They also commented that they are likely to buy El Paso at a 10.5 PE soon (even though ours is currently 12.5 and they believe in us) because they just have more access to El Paso Sr Mgmt and understand their biz better. (Lot of El Paso and Dynegy support out there). They were never short us. On other names: EOG- could see it down to $22 but see $35 based on NAV more realistic. Like EOG and Chesapeake- well hedged. Also like Philips/ Statoil on the Alaskan gas play as well as the fact that they have 0 mid-east exposure. Like Talisman- only has exposure in Sydan, Nexus- Yemen",Positive,2001

Reuters English News Service, 05/22/01 May 28, 2001 TIME Magazine Topping Out In Houston Again BY CATHY = BOOTH THOMAS/DALLAS Send the architects south. Silicon Valley may be power= less and profitless, but Houston, the nation's energy capital and home to t= he oil-baron excesses of the 1980s, is back in ""bidness."" The energy giants= in Texas have big fat wallets these days--and even bigger construction pla= ns. Not since the boom days of 1982, when trophy architects like Philip Joh= nson and I.M. Pei reconfigured the skyline, has Houston seen so much constr= uction activity by the energy sector. Leading the parade, ironically, is E= nron, an old energy behemoth that has reinvented itself as a high-tech trad= ing firm dealing in everything from natural gas to Internet bandwidth. In f= act, its new 40-story headquarters, designed by Cesar Pelli, will be fronte= d by a seven-story ""podium""--or shorter building--to house what Enron is ca= lling the largest commodities-trading environment in the world. This envir= onment, spread over four floors, each the size of a city block, will become= home this August to 2,000 employees trading commodities that range from Ol= d World (crude oil, petrochemicals, steel and lumber) to New World (emissio= n credits and derivatives). Chairman Kenneth Lay and CEO Jeff Skilling are = even moving from their skyboxes to work in seventh-floor offices so they ca= n peer down into the pit. When the bigger 40-story structure is finished i= n December, Enron's will be the first new skyscraper in downtown Houston si= nce 1987--to be followed by three more by 2003. Besides Enron, Calpine Corp= ., the nation's leading independent-power company, based in California, wil= l move into a new 32-story high-rise. And Reliant Resources, the IPO spun o= ff this month from its Houston parent to deal with Texas' new deregulated e= lectricity market, has signed on for offices in a 36-story skyscraper. Wha= t's fueling the high-rise fever is simple: excess cash. Enron's first-quart= er revenues were up 281%, while Calpine's revenues and net income were each= up more than 400%--even with California's deadbeat utility PG&E owing the = company more than $300 million. After a decade of contraction in the busin= ess, with companies having shut offices from New Orleans to Oklahoma, dereg= ulation and new marketing strategies are sparking Houston's renaissance. ""E= nron is a leading example of the new energy industry. Ten years ago, there = were no trading floors,"" points out Stephen Brown, senior economist with th= e Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas. Both Calpine and Reliant will also have t= rading operations in their new offices. Though Houston no longer relies so= heavily on the energy business (down to 48% of the local economy from 82% = in 1982) the turnaround sure feels good after the city lost more than 15,00= 0 energy-sector jobs two years ago, says Barton Smith, director of the Inst= itute for Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston. It has gained = those jobs back, plus some. Says Smith: ""The current boom is what's keeping= Houston afloat while the rest of the country is suffering."" None of this = matters to real Houston lovers, of course. They're just interested in bragg= ing rights. After a bad decade, they're beginning to sound like the biggest= and the best in Texas again. ""Boomlet?"" says Laura Schwartz, spokeswoman a= t Enron. ""It's more than a mini-boom. It's a boom."" =09 Enron to meet government for talks on power dispute By RAMOLA TALWAR BADAM Associated Press Writer 05/22/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press.

Sent: Thursday, August 09, 2001 2:32 PM John - I want to float an idea past you to see if you have any interest. In the past, I have not made a habit of participating in PaineWebber syndicate offerings because, frankly, investment banking was not our strong suit. Now, with the UBS merger, our deal flow is starting to look much better (see press release below). 5.79% isn't a mind-blowing number, but it is impressive in light of market conditions and the fact that ""UBS Warburg was the only bank to have a positive return among the 17 banks listed including Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Salomon Smith Barney."" As the market rebounds, I think you may benefit from participation in IPOs and other syndicate deals. If you have an interest in this, let me know and we'll discuss it further. Thanks. January 12, 2001 UBS Warburg has been ranked first in IPO performance for US offerings in 2000, according to Commscan's Equidesk. Achieving a 5.79% return, the result is particularly significant considering the Bank was not involved in any of the top 10 largest IPOs of the year. Lead managing 12 IPOs, UBS Warburg was the only bank to have a positive return among the 17 banks listed including Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Salomon Smith Barney. UBS Warburg also tied first place for IPO ""batting average"" (the % of IPOs that trade above issue price), achieving the highest ""batting average"" overall. Three deals in 2000 which helped achieve these impressive statistics include Intermune Pharmaceuticals, Luminex, and Bruker Daltonics.

The work that Dave Forster did was just for front month. That creates month 1. Then, similar logic has to create a month 1/month 2 spread to create a month 2 outright market. Same for month 2/ month 3 to create month 3. There might be 24-36 individual markets to create a forward curve. Sometimes month 1 has correlation to the month 1/ month 2 spread.

Sounds like Jake in two years. Sent: Thursday, May 17, 2001 11:28 AM As you may know, the only person more arrogant than an investment banker is someone in private equity. Investment bankers pride themselves on making vast amounts of money, but a successful private equity professional takes devilish pride and supports an even bigger ego for working fewer hours while making even more money than his (rarely her) investment banking brethren. Unfortunately, some members of the private equity community mistakenly believe that their growing wealth is the result of their own talent and charming personality rather than a simple profiting from the hoarding of capital, as Karl Marx so astutely described. Consider the plight of Peter Chung (see attached email), a recent hire at the Carlyle Group. After completing his two-year stint as an Analyst at Merrill Lynch, Chung was persuaded to seek out new opportunities in Korea working as part of Carlyle's vast Asian investment team. Working at a private equity firm allows Chung to check out Korean night clubs (which would be legally classified as brothels in the United States) 3-4 times a week, though Chung made it clear that he needs only two months to ""learn a little bit of the buyside business"" so he can begin nightly visits. Already a self-described ""stud"" on the New York City dating scene, Chung looked to the emerging island of Korea where the standard of living for young foreign men is bolstered by the low per capita income of native residents (roughly $12,600 per person). By making in excess of ten times the average national wage, Chung quickly found himself to be quite the ladies man as the locals were attracted to his fat wallet and U.S. citizenship. Thus bolstered by an initial rendezvous or two, Chung decided to cement his legacy by setting out on the quixotic mission to sleep with all of the fine women of Korea. As of May 15, 2001, Chung alludes to having had sexual relations with five ""hot chicks."" According to Chung's own calculations, there are roughly one billion ""hot chicks"" remaining in Korea. Clearly there is a break in Chung's sexual predator model as he apparently believes that not only is the global female population of 3 billion comprised of 1/3 hot Korean chicks, but he will be able to sleep with that many before his finest member falls off or he dies of exhaustion. Sadly, Chung cannot complete his mission alone. The quality of prophylactics in Korea are not quite up to U.S. standards (Chung would probably claim Korean condoms are too small) and he needs your help to continue his quest for infamy. If you would like to contribute to this valiant mission, please direct your gift of a FDA-approved ""domes"" to the address below: Peter Chung The Carlyle Group Suite 1009, CCMM Bldg. 12, Yoido-dong, Youngdeungpo-ku Seoul 150-010, Korea Chung asks that you consider using FedEx or another international overnight courier since he may be on the verge of running out of protection.

Since leaving the White House, Jim Baker has continued his international mission to spread goodwill and STDs throughout the world by supporting young Romeos such as Mr. Chung. For a first-hand account of life in private equity, please read Peter Chung's travelogue (attached). Please keep in mind that Chung's experience is partially a function of his prior status as a ""stud"" and may not be reflective of private equity experiences in general. Not all of us can hope to be as smart, debonair and modest as Mr. Chung. Regards, Justin ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---- So I've been in Korea for about a week and a half now and what can I say, LIFE IS GOOD.... I've got a spanking brand new 2000 sq. foot 3 bedroom apt. with a 200 sq. foot terrace running the entire length of my apartment with a view overlooking Korea's main river and nightline......Why do I need 3 bedrooms? Good question,.... the main bedroom is for my queen size bed,...where CHUNG is going to fuck every hot chick in Korea over the next 2 years (5 down, 1,000,000,000 left to go).... the second bedroom is for my harem of chickies, and the third bedroom is for all of you fuckers when you come out to visit my ass in Korea. I go out to Korea's finest clubs, bars and lounges pretty much every other night on the weekdays and everyday on the weekends to (I think in about 2 months, after I learn a little bit of the buyside business I'll probably go out every night on the weekdays). I know I was a stud in NYC but I pretty much get about, on average, 5-8 phone numbers a night and at least 3 hot chicks that say that they want to go home with me every night I go out. I love the buyside,.... I have bankers calling me everyday with opportunties and they pretty much cater to my every whim - you know (golfing events, lavish dinners, a night out clubbing). The guys I work with are also all chilll - I live in the same apt building as my VP and he drives me around in his Porsche (1 of 3 in all of Korea) to work and when we go out. What can I say,.... live is good,... CHUNG is KING of his domain here in Seoul..... So,.... all of you fuckers better keep in touch and start making plans to come out and visit my ass ASAP, I'll show you guys an unbelievable time....My contact info is below.... Oh, by the way,... someone's gotta start fedexing me boxes of domes,...I brought out about 40 but I think I'll run out of them by Saturday.....

You should be ready to defend your answer. Only a number is allowed, not an algebraic equation. Acquiring a Company In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer), which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of a tender offer. You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares but are unsure how high a price to offer. The main complication is this: the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil exploration project it is currently undertaking. Indeed, the very viability of Company T depends on the exploration outcome. If the project fails, the company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share. But if the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management could be as high as $100/share. All share values between $0 and $100 are considered equally likely. By all estimates, the company will be worth considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management. In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under Company T. If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under either management. If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under current management, the value under Company A is $75/share. Similarly, a $100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company A, and so on. The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the price they should offer for Company T's shares. This offer must be made now, before the outcome of the drilling project is known. From all indications, Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a profitable price. Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the potential of a takeover bid by any other firm. You expect Company T to delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches the press. Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration project when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when deciding whether or not to accept your offer. In addition, Company T will accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of the company under current management. Thus, if you offer $50/share, for instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is anything less than $50. As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price offers in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to $150/share. What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's stock? $ per/share",Neutral,2001

Sent: Monday, October 29, 2001 4:44 PM sorry not to send this earlier.. i checked out the dept water resources site.. (wwwowe.water.ca.gov).. nothing too illuminating except that their power costs have come down from over $300 in march to$45 this month but due to the nature the borrowing costs associated with the LT contracts, they will not be able to pass on much savings to consumers (gotta love that). we were supposed to have received a copy of all their LT purchases in July. checking what happened there. we know that there were 54 contracts signed .. half linked to gas which covered 1/3 of cali's total needs (looks like for 10 years). some left open the possibility of the state procuring gas supplies for the plants.. dwr has signed 6 agreements w/ gas suppliers..pretty sure cali uses 25,000-45,000 MW per year which is about 70 contracts a day in gas terms. If they locked in 1/3.. it would be about 25/day.. the deal they just did was about 16/day for just cal02..probably waiting for curve to flatten further to do more.. they purchased another 500 MW in Aug - the 17th (all 10-12 years)..and to date it looks like they have not purchased anything (have been selling into the grid daily) but not liquidating any previously negotiated LT deals (LT is anything beyond 3 months). it sounds like they are planning on buying more of their gas requirements.. Sempra (who has LT power contracts with DWR and gives them the ability to buy 80% of their gas) said DWR had not purchased any gas yet. Pls note story on page 5 & 6 of todays gas daily... mentions California Dept of Water looking to hedge gas purchases for long-term contracts. over the past few days we have seen Major Inv. Bk Buying Cal 02 Nymex Calls and the same bank buying Cal 02 Socal basis calls - very good size This, we believe, is a hedge for this DWR story. The article mentions that they were ""looking at ways to expand its gas purchases"". The article does not mention, nor do we know, how far out they are looking to purchase. Socal basis has moved on the back of this deal.... Last week: Cal 02 = 9 cents Cal 03 = 20 cents Today Cal 02 = 18.5 cents Cal 03 = 22 cents....so the spread has moved from 11 cent contango to 3.5 cents. <<102401.pdf>> Other than the call buying we saw related to this deal, the rest of the flow we are seeing is : sellers of vol.

Robert Collins, Jr., President RE: EXCHANGE ANNOUNCES PLANS TO INTRODUCE OVER-THE-COUNTER CLEARING EXCHANGE ANNOUNCES PLANS TO INTRODUCE OVER-THE-COUNTER CLEARING The board of directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., last night approved a series of measures to offer credit intermediation through clearing services and trading tools for the over-the-counter (OTC) natural gas market. This plan will include the introduction of exchange of futures for swap (EFS) transactions and large order execution to the natural gas futures market within the next few weeks, along with the previously announced electronic trading of cleared natural gas swaps and basis contracts. Recent events in the natural gas market have served to reinforce the necessity of counterparty credit risk management and have accelerated the Exchange's plans to introduce a full array of risk management tools under the umbrella of our clearinghouse. Combining these trading vehicles with our Henry Hub futures contract will offer market participants the advantages of these instruments in conjunction with one of the most liquid commodity markets in the world and provide greater stability to the market as a whole. The Exchange is in a unique leadership position to offer these services with natural gas futures and options volume in 2000 reaching the equivalent of approximately 230 trillion cubic feet and the notional value of last year's transactions Exchange-wide totaling $3 trillion, or $14 billion per day. One half billion dollars is available to participants on each of the Exchange divisions through each guarantee fund and the respective clearing members. EFS transactions will work similarly to exchange of futures for physical (EFP) transactions. Two parties will be allowed to privately negotiate the execution of an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures transaction on pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties. The transaction must involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market quantities of futures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities and will be permitted until two hours after trading terminates in the underlying futures contract. EFS transactions will be permitted to liquidate, initiate, and transfer futures market positions between the two parties involved in the transaction. The clearing member representing each party will be responsible to notify the Exchange of the amount and type of futures contracts involved, the price at which the futures transaction should be cleared, and the identity of the parties involved. The Exchange will also begin permitting traders to execute block trades of 250 natural gas futures contracts or more in the first two nearby months at the best bid or offer for that size. These trades will not be permitted during the closing range. Early next year, the Exchange will introduce a cleared Henry Hub natural gas swaps contract, providing the marketplace with direct clearing on the most popular energy swaps contract over the last several year. As part of this move, the Exchange will clear OTC-executed transactions through its EFS mechanism.",Positive,2001

The project was looking at statistics of accidents that occured in a certain hospital, evaluating the correlations over a few years, making suggestions on how to improve and explaining why certain things were happening. I am not sure if that will help in an internship. What department in a company would that have to do with? I think I might be interested in that.

Sent: Tuesday, October 09, 2001 2:02 PM The World Wide RibFest ""celebration of the Rib"" is coming up. This will be the 5th annual ribfest, and John Mee has his work cut out for him to defend the title he won last year (for the second time). I believe he will have a tough time, as the competition looks increasingly focused on unseating the former Bostonian from his Throne. For those of you who haven't been to a ribfest in the past, it's a barbeque competition where 5 to 7 cooks compete to see who can produce the best Baby Back Ribs (if you want those Fred Flintstone beef ribs, you ain't getting them here). A blind-judging takes place to determine the winner, but often the crowd gets up in arms and nominates a ""peoples choice"" (though this is not officially recognized by the sanctioning body). Every year, my wife asks the following: ""So, besides Ribs, beer and margaritas, what else will be served?"" I reply: ""Nothing comes to mind."" She replies: ""No."" As you might expect, she wins this discussion year in, year out. So, appetizers, sides, desserts and food & drink for the kids are also served. The competition around the grills gets a little rough, so I recommend that the young and faint-of-heart maintain a safe distance while the cooking and competition is taking place. The appropriate College football games will be broadcast, so you don't have to worry about missing any games. There are a couple of changes to this year's competition: The competition will be held at the John Mee/Laura Benjamins compound in Bellaire Mike Paradise (who won the very first ribfest) has stepped out of the competition this year citing ""personal reasons"" Date & Time Saturday November 3rd. We fire the grills up around 12:00, and the judging takes place between 3:00 and 3:30. Where 4807 Elm Street in Bellaire Directions (from John Mee himself) From downtown, take 59s to 610s. The first exit is the Bissonette//Fournace exit. Take this exit and go through the light, noting the gouging in the lamppost from that freak cherry-picker accident from last April. Before the Bisonette light, there is a big Chase Bank Building. Right before that building is Elm Street. Take a right on Elm Street exactly 236 yards to 4807 Elm Street. Go inside and ask for directions there, cause I really don't have a clue... KIDS Bring 'em! We'll have the Moonwalk set up for them again this year, and we'll have hot dogs, burgers, popcorn and drinks for them. The more kids the better. What you need to bring Nothing, except maybe some attitude to heckle the cooks while they try to concentrate.

You should be ready to defend your answer. Only a number is allowed, not an algebraic equation. Acquiring a Company In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer), which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of a tender offer. You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares but are unsure how high a price to offer. The main complication is this: the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil exploration project it is currently undertaking. Indeed, the very viability of Company T depends on the exploration outcome. If the project fails, the company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share. But if the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management could be as high as $100/share. All share values between $0 and $100 are considered equally likely. By all estimates, the company will be worth considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management. In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under Company T. If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under either management. If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under current management, the value under Company A is $75/share. Similarly, a $100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company A, and so on. The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the price they should offer for Company T's shares. This offer must be made now, before the outcome of the drilling project is known. From all indications, Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a profitable price. Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the potential of a takeover bid by any other firm. You expect Company T to delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches the press. Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration project when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when deciding whether or not to accept your offer. In addition, Company T will accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of the company under current management. Thus, if you offer $50/share, for instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is anything less than $50. As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price offers in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to $150/share.

It helps us discuss it internally. Recently our internal compliance folks have discussed the ""give-up risk"". Specifically, what guarantee do we have that the executor's (Enron) FCM will accept the block trade and get it to the exchange on behalf of our clients? There is some concern that there might be limits imposed by the FCM due to issues such as credit and the high volatility of NG. They have requested we sign a four (or more) party give-up agreement between Campbell, Enron, your clearing firm(s) and our clearing firm(s). Is this the SOP as you envision the NYMEX EFS? We are at the point where the specific documentation issues are the main obstacles to moving forward. If we buy 1,000 NG from you, how do we know your FCM can guarantee acceptance of the trade for further give-up? Your legal feedback is welcome.
