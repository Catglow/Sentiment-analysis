Sent: Tuesday, October 2, 2001 11:26 AM As you are all aware, the latest Risk Management Policy specifically addresses Operational Risk, and more specifically commits Enron to develop systems and processes that enable Enron to better evaluate its operational risk. To that end, I have asked Wanda Curry to lead a cross-functional team (the ""Operational Risk Committee""), which will be jointly accountable for meeting this commitment. I would like to have representatives from Enron Assurance Services, RAC, Research, Information Technology, GRMO and Arthur Anderson. Enron's primary objective for monitoring its exposure to operational risk is to (a) identify the derivation of operational risk exposures and (b) improve the Company's systems and processes to mitigate such risk. The guidelines for operational risk assessment are essentially undeveloped. It will be our challenge to identify, assess, categorize, quantify and mitigate exposure to operational risk. The risk capital allocation process includes the consideration of operational risk. Initially, this assessment will be based on a qualitative view of the business unit's internal processes, people and systems. The initial goal, for completion prior to year-end 2001, is to establish a baseline and/or report card to convey a sense for where we are now. It is Enron's objective, as reflected in the Risk Management Policy, to increase the sophistication of risk measurement for operational risks through documented qualitative assessments and quantitative measurements. A list of additional objectives to be addressed by the cross functional team has been prepared by Wanda. These include: Develop a qualitative operational risk assessment approach and implement. This approach should enable a quick review of key functions and standards to identify weaknesses, monitor progress over time, and provide management with a representation of operational risk. Assess and improve integrity of daily risk reports, i.e. require confirmation that all books are captured, aggregated and processed through RisktRAC, CreditAg, and Infinity applications Ascertain the extent of spreadsheet usage across Enron and develop the ability to monitor NOP, and MTM for spreadsheets separately, i.e. a Spreadsheet DPR. Work with GRMO to develop ""rules of use"" for financial valuation models and spreadsheet ""books"" Utilize the existing RMS database and develop the ability to monitor intercompany - interbook activity (initially for forward positions only) and report variances Recommend metrics for quantitative measurement of operational risk Access need for additional or improved risk databases Wanda will be contacting each of you to identify your designated operational risk contact that will participate on this cross-functional team.

Credit is going to request an invoice from them stating what we owe them. When that comes in someone in credit will sign off on this request.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage. This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00. If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. The Saturn Ring that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage. The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060 with any questions.

As you can see, this distribution protects your rate base against a rising price environment and partially floats with market prices as they move down. The distribution ( fixed price vs floating ) may move up a percent or two in relation to the outright price desk that we face today ( relative to the historical numbers) but those iterations can be made as required. Pls review and we can discuss at your convenience. Also, as discussed, I am looking for ways to enhance our ability to transact with you on gas structures but in light of the overall credit positions that may be difficult. With that being said however, I do believe that we can stream some structures to the physical contracts in gas and ensure that from the physical point of view ENA and SPPC are both protected and I would like to pursue this with you. One area that I would like to start with to have SPPC sell ENA physical gas ( 30,000/40,000/day) against a physical gas daily related price. Once I have accumulated a payables position, we inherently create a secured line without having to change any of the contracts/paper currently in place. I am also sure this will require further discussions and look forward to catching up with you soonest. regards, Barry Tycholiz Sent: Friday, October 19, 2001 9:25 AM",Neutral,2001

FERC was made aware of the Compression Services arrangement with ECS in the filings for the certification of the Kachina units. FERC simply didn't ask any further questions in that proceeding. The Operation & Maintenance Agreements in place for the Kachina units essentially accomplishes the same tasks as the Operational Control Agreement in Gallup. TW feels the O&M agreements would be adequate to address any concerns about TW's regulatory responsibility over the compressor facilities. The Operational Control agreement was put into place in the Gallup Transaction because it was thought to be easier to give FERC exactly what is was looking for rather than provide them with the Gallup O&M Agreement which might unecessarily complicate the certification process at that time. 2. There is no basis in FERC Regs or the NGA for FERC to impose any type of penalty or discontinue the Compression Service due to TW's operation of Kachina without the Operational Control Agreement. No regs or law address this situation. Again this is tempered by the fact that FERC was made aware of the arrangement and didn't ask any questions and the O&M agreement is in place to accomplish control for TW. 3. I also faxed you a copy of Section 19(c) of the NGA which indicates that the petition for rehearing does not effect the status of the certificate. Construction is moving ahead and the targeted start date is May 1. I will forward the filing TW made wrt to the Operational Control Agreement as soon as I recieve it.

Many thanks, Kim. Sent: Thu 8/2/2001 10:49 AM Is the message that is sent via EDI the same as the message that is displayed on our Web site? If not, can you explain why there would be a difference? Sent: Tuesday, July 31, 2001 2:30 PM Everyone, As stated below in Rich's memo, the quantities that will be posted in the new daily unsubscribed report are the same quantities that TW is currently sending in EDI files. As part of the permanent solution, the EDI process will need to be modied when the website is modified. I would like to review messages that are sent in TW EDI files for unsubscribed capacity and operationally available capacity. TW currently sends a text message with each of the EDI unsubscribed capacity files that are sent to customers. This message is: Capacity at these points is subject to the capacity available on the relevant path for the receipt and delivery point combination(s) requested. (2) Please contact your Marketing Representative for information concerning point with capacity less than 5,000 Mcf/day. (3) Transwestern is willing to consider expressions of interest concerning available capacity or requests for capacity. Shipper interested in available capacity may either contact their Marketing Representative or submit a request for service to Transwestern Transportation Marketing, P.O.Box 1188, Houston, Texas 77251-1199 or by facsimile to (713)646-8000. For operationally available capacity, TW currently sends the following text message with each EDI operationally available file: The below listed capacity is an estimate of the unutilized capacity that will be available on the effective date above, until further notice is posted. The capacity is only an estimate and is subject to change without notice due to the transient nature of pipeline operations. There are no guarantees expressed or implied that this capacity will be available. Formal nominations to the pipeline will be processed in accordance witht he company's tariff provisions for scheduling of all available capacity. Please review and let me know if any revisions need to be made to the above text messages. Thanks, Mary Sent: Tuesday, July 31, 2001 7:28 AM In a meeting to discuss a new FERC commission ruling, it was decided that TW needs to post daily unsubscribed capacity information to the web by August 10th. Since the daily numbers will be the same as the monthly numbers for August through October, we will post the monthly numbers published through the new TW unsubscribed capacity system as if they were daily numbers. The posting will be for two days in advance. (i.e. on August 1, we will post numbers for August 3). Since these will be the same numbers used by EDI, TW's unsubscribed capacity EDI will not need to change at this time. To do this, TW's new unsubscribed capacity posting must be in production by the 10th. We will do our best to be ready for testing the daily posting by Monday, August 5. (Jeanne & Patty - is August 6th doable for testing and August 10th doable for production?) This is only a temporary solution until further analysis can be done to design the correct solution. The permanent solution must be in place before November 1.

One more thing I did not address. My ultimate goal is to move all volume to EOL. However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viable electronic trading systems. We make it a point to never support these if possible. We will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greater than our bid. For instance, if we are 6/8 but have a strong inclination to buy and another system is at 7, I will simultaneously lift their 7's and move my market to 7/9. The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the trade if I'm bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade to him. People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other systems because they will just get picked off. If they don't post numbers on the other systems, the systems get no liquidity and die. I mention this because I have heard that Enron is a fairly large trader on Spectron's system. I don't know whether it is in regards to gas, power, or metals. Just something to think about and maybe talk about with the other traders.

I don't know how Ballentine's language works--there doesn't seem to be an offer and acceptance of anything specific. I'd like to at least have a contract that has either been negotiated with the third party of the ability to negotiate it myself. Can we clean this language up a little? Dan Sent: Monday, October 08, 2001 1:17 PM Thanks John. For your convenience in reviewing the language, I have attached a redline copy that shows the changes that John made to our original language. Regarding his changes: 1. A big omission in his new section is the covenant not to construct or cause to be constructed a natural gas pipeline within the right of way. I thought that was a covenant we wanted. If that is not the business deal, then the change is fine. 2. I think a 10 business days is fine. That being said, you usually don't indicate an acceptance of a right to match with the payment of the purchase offer. We could submit a binding acceptance but I don't think we want to agree to pay the purchase price when all that Ballentine may put in front of us is a term sheet with the specifics of the deal to be negotiated. I also don't think we want to go to the trouble of escrowing the money. Maybe we could do an earnest money deposit but then we need to add language as to when we get it back. (If you and Danny want to keep the submission of the purchase price, we need to include the language as to when we get the money back as well.) The easiest fix for this deal is just saying we will submit a binding acceptance to their offer. Let me know your thoughts.

Buyer agrees that within one year of the Date of this Agreement if it receives a bona fide offer (the ""Purchase Offer"") to acquire the right to construct or to place into service natural gas and/or liquid pipelines within the Company's right-of-way, Buyer will first, by written notice to Seller, offer to Seller the right to construct or to place into service natural gas and/or liquid pipelines within the Company's right-of-way on the same terms and conditions as the Purchase Offer (the ""ROFR Offer""). The written notice provided by Buyer shall state (i) that Buyer has received the Purchase Offer and intends to accept such Purchase Offer and (ii) the terms and conditions of the Purchase Offer. Seller shall have five (5) business days from receipt of the ROFR Offer to indicate its willingness to match the Purchase Offer by submitting by wire transfer to Buyer's designated bank account the Purchase Offer in immediately available funds.. If Seller does not indicate its willingness to match the Purchase Offer or does not respond within five (5) days, then Buyer may consummate the transaction with the counterparty, provided that the transaction consummated with counterparty is on the same terms and conditions set forth in the ROFR Offer. If the transaction with counterparty is modified in any respect from that set forth in the ROFR Offer, the modified terms and conditions shall be deemed to constitute a new Purchase Offer and Seller shall be entitled to a new right to match the Purchase Offer as set forth above in this Section 4.06. In the event that Seller matches the Purchase Offer by submitting funds to Buyers designated bank account, Seller shall assume all other terms and conditions of the Purchase Offer, including, but not limited to, any limitations, restrictions or preferences of the selection of the construction company or any other contractors normally associated with the construction, operation and maintenance of gas and liquid pipelines.

Is there a timeline on when FERC may act (or at least when the Audit) will be final? Is this information confidential? Should we be working the trade press? Thanks, Jim Sent: Thursday, October 18, 2001 4:51 PM A conference call was held today with FERC staffers to discuss items of interest or concern to us. Participating for FERC were Bob Pease (enforcement att'y), Stuart Fisher (economist) and Bruce Poole (engineer). Alan Comnes, Dave Perrino and I weighed in for Enron. The laundry list of topics discussed is attached. We expressed the sentiment that the root cause of all these issues and concerns is the current composition (and non-independence) of the ISO board, and suggested that the ISO board situation should be the subject of the upcoming FERC audit of ISO. We went on to discuss the audit further and the fact that there is no established or formal comment process. However, we were invited to file written comments with the Commission on what we thought should be audited, and Alan is taking the lead on this. We will try to get others to sign on to the comments. Some of the discussion items that the staff was highly interested in included: ISO request for a bid from us to prop up the price (staff requested a copy of the transcript). Any unexplained decreases in ATC (staff asked to be advised in real time). Information related to ISO OOM purchases (and whether they were declining). All in all, it was a successful, informal call lasting about 40 minutes. Staff was receptive to and agreed to receive periodic calls from us in the future. This allows them to keep up with what is going on industry, and of course gives us an opportunity to educate and alert them on issues of interest to us. Ray << File: audit points.doc >>",Neutral,2001

Since we did not deliver anything to them on that day, the settlement will occur at GD-.10. Originally, we were working on a spot deal for this day. Then, after the fact, we agreed to let the deal fall out under the exchagne deal. I apparantly forgot to change the deal ticket. For the weekend of 8/5, we need to prorate the gas over the weekend. Due to operational issues, we agreed to receive gas all weekend and batch the deliveries on Monday. I apologize for not getting this info to you earlier. D Enron North America Corp. cc: Stacey Daren: I am having trouble with 8/00. The first issue is day 1 of the purchase at Fuels Cotton. We have two deals in Sitara, spot deal 348951 and exchange deal 157288. You had said previously that we would know a spot deal had occurred by the new deal ticket and the different pricing. Since there was a spot deal, we put all of the volume for day 1 on deal 348951. Duke says that day 1 was not a spot and that it should be on the exchange deal and priced at GD - 0.10. The exchange deal is currently price at index - 0.05. Please let me know which deal we are suppose to use and what the price should be. The second issue is the sale volume on deal 157278 for 8/00. Duke is telling me that we sold them a batch of gas on the 7th, which we see, but that we are suppose to prorate the gas over the 5th, 6th, and 7th for the exchange. This is a problem since gas was not confirmed for the 5th and 6th and pipeline shows all of the gas on the 7th. This is a daily swing meter which electronically feeds into settlements. We don't normally change these meters. If you intended for us to prorate this gas, I will need your OK. The emails below are from Marta at Duke notifying us of the change. Megan",Neutral,2000

Fred Lombardo has been handling the fuel management responsibilities from Pittsburgh and will leave CES at the end of February. CES is outsourcing these management responsibilities to Alliance Energy Services. CES has a term supply contract with Enron for 6900 delivered to Union Camp and this expires at the end of March 2000. CES is in agreement that Enron will continue to nominate this gas until the end of March 2000. The Contract signed between CES and Enron, states that ENA has the agency rights for the International Paper Contract. Enron's understanding is that Enron will continue to nominate this contract until CES's fuel management responsibilities expire in 2002. Colleen and Melissa, please ensure both companies are on the same page. Fred Lomabardo and his boss, Don Deal, were going to outsource the nomination rights of this contract to Alliance Energy.

Here is some information that you probably are already aware of, but just in case...... You may recall that Com Ed sold all of their coal-fired units and gas fired units to EME (Edison Mission Energy). I don't remember exactly how many megawatts are now owned and controlled by Mission, but it is between 15,000 and 20,000 MW throughout Northern Illinois. Mission's union has authorized a strike to be effective June 1. Unlike Peoples, Mission does not have many management employees in the Chicago area (Mission is a California-based corporation). Therefore the odds of the plants remaining in operation during a strike are low. They would likely keep a couple of key plants on, and the rest would idle. Power prices currently do not support operation of Allegheny or Constellation, but a large outage may change that. Bill Quigley has some good contacts that have been keeping him up to date on the status of this. If they strike we may see Allegheny, Constellation and Elwood fire even when weather is not extreme. --Tim ---------------------------------------------------------------- The information transmitted is intended only for the person or entity to which it is addressed and may contain confidential and/or privileged material.

Wessex will provide ED with its I&C database and, should Wessex decide to enter into the residential power and gas market, ED could provide site registration and gas/power price risk management services to sit behind the Wessex brand. Given that Wessex is Enron's biggest retail platform in Europe, have you given any thought as to how it could be closer integrated with Enron Direct generally? Given current market conditions, I expect Enron will have little choice but to hold onto Wessex for the time being which isn't necessarily a bad thing. There could obviously be some regulatory issues in bringing our retail water and energy businesses together, though I think it is worth looking at. ED has 150,000 I&C customers across the UK, making it a good fit for Wessex. Also, if the Water market opens up to competition in the future, there would be benefits for Wessex.

I usually use the BCC field when sending smack notes like this so everybody won't get barraged with weak Reply All's from recipients who think they can go toe to toe with me in e-mail smack (i.e. Val and his weak shit he likes to send). This time is different because I think y'all should know who your fellow pathetic smack talking LSU fans are. Y'all can start a new support group - called ""Vassigh's College Football Smacked down Bitches - that got their cakeholes shut by Chris Simms, Cedric Benson, and Roy Williams et al"" Y'all have dished it all out, so I do not feel bad for rubbing salt into the fatal wound that Ole Miss delivered you and your team Saturday night. Here a couple of smack statements made by some if not all of the cajun's included in this e-mail header. ""Simms sucks, how could he be a preseason heisman candidate?"" - Over his last three games, Simms is 59-of-88 (67.0 percent) for 698 yards and 12 touchdowns passing 2 touchdowns rushing with just one interception (176.41 rating). He has just started about ONE full seasons worth of games recently and is coming into his own. Simms will be a top NFL pick as will Roy Williams and Cedric Benson. I can't think of any College Football team in history with the high caliber triple threat that UT has with Simms, Benson, and Williams. ""The SEC is the best conference in football, the Big XII Sucks"" - What a joke that statement is. ""LSU would whip UT"" - Yeah right - LSU Could not beat Rice. ""UT is the most overrated team in college football"" - interesting since they are higher ranked now in November than they were in the preseason polls. ""Mack Brown can only recruit - he can't coach worth a damn - Nick Saban is better"" - Mack Brown has one loss - he hasn't lost in Austin since he has been coach - while Saban has led LSU to three losses - 2 in the Red Stick - just THIS SEASON. Every college football analyst would agree no conference compares to the Big XII. The BIG XII have 3 TEAMS RANKED IN THE TOP 5 early November - unbelievable! Two of the top ranked BIG XII team's only losses were to the other top ranked BIG XII school. UT loss to OU and OU loss to Nebraska. The only way the best teams in the Big XII lose is when they have to play against each other. The highest ranked SEC team (Florida) lost to Auburn which lost to pathetic Arkansas. All football players worth a damn have left y'alls God Forsaken state. Peyton to Tennessee, Marshall Faulk to SDSU, the newest Manning to Ole Miss that just whipped up on y'alls 3rd world state university in the Red Stick on national television on a cool October Saturday night. Cajuns like Jake Delhomme and Bobby Bouchieaux stay in Lousyanna to play college ball though - that's some encouraging news for y'all. I can't think of one LSU player that has ever done shit in the NFL. NFL teams have gotten screwed every time they drafted a Lousyanna State football player. David Lafleur, Kevin Faulk, Harvey Williams, Eddie Kennison - the list goes on and on. It is really pathetic. Texas has just RECENTLY produced dominating hausses like Ricky, Tony Brackens, Dan Neil, Shaun Rogers, Leonard Davis, Priest Holmes, Blake Brockermeyer, Bryant Westbrook, and many others. Look at Eric Metcalf in his first game back to the NFL for the Redskins - breaking NFL records. Texas players are magic baby. Not to mention legends like the Tyler Rose, Tom Landry, Bobby Layne, and Tommy Nobis I hope y'all enjoy Shreveport on a cold December night while y'all attend Lousyanna States bowl game against Fresno State at the Independence bowl. At least you can enjoy the New Years holiday by watching the NFL like offense of The University of Texas Longhorns play in a BCS bowl and God willing with some magic from TAMU over the Texas Traitor filled roster of OU and some other help - watch UT vs. Miami in the Rose Bowl. I guess that smack from Elliot saying Rohan was better than Simms seems pretty foolish to you now doesn't it. That dude needs to play linebacker if he wants to get in the NFL. He might have a decent arm but he has no clue in the pocket, The difference between how Eli Manning ran the passing game and Rohan did for LSU Saturday night showed LSU's deficiency at the QB position. Fumbling, bumbling, stumbling is the best way to describe his play. CKL - you better buy your family Christmas gifts from the dollar store because you need to save your money to pay on the $500 bet you made with me the night of Val's wedding in that little bar in Natchez, Mississippi. You boldly put your soon departed money where your mouth was all night, since all you were ranting was ""tiger bait, tiger bait"" any time I was trying to tell you how UT would whip up on LSU like the 3 lesser ranked teams have already done this season. The bet for $500 was to go to the person whose team would be ranked higher at the end of the 2001 College Football season: Me = University of Texas You = LSU. Well since UT is in the top 5 and with a worst case scenario would not finish out of the top 15 this year and the fact that LSU will not even finish the season ranked - you need to start saving your extra pocket cash - or we can work out an installment plan. Lenhart was a witness as well was another of Val's amigos (I forgot the name but know the face). It looks like history will keep on repeating itself with the Great State of Texas always being superior in every facet over it's little cajun neighbor to the east - Lousyanna. Texas has the winningest NFL team of all time in the Dallas Cowboys, the 3 time champions and top 4 ranked Texas Longhorns. Conversely Lousyanna has the losingest NFL team of all time in the Aints, and the doormat of the pathetic SEC west Lousyanna State university. The last Governor of Texas is the President of the United States and leader of the free world. The last Governor of Lousyanna is in prison licking Boudreaux's balls for the next 15 years or so. And the bottom line is that y'all are in my State working because there are no jobs outside of casinos and bars in Lousyanna Even the only bright spots in the pathetic history of y'alls only professional sports franchise is provided by Texas players - Earl Campbell and Ricky Williams. He who laughs last laughs best. Man this note is a classic. I think I will be sending it to Jim Rome.

The major concern is that in Australia special damages has a near opposite meaning to the US. The suggested amendment to clause 3(c) I believe we could dispense with. It relates to a concern that an Enron acceptance may be accessible on the Website Server. However, from what I have been told this is not a foreseeable eventuality. GTCs - Minor changes.

Best regards, Jeff Jay 05/09/2001 08:55 AM cc: Jeff- As you may know, I have (somewhat reluctantly) decided to resign from Enron. For some time now, I have wanted to take some time off, and had asked Whalley about the possibility for a six month unpaid, unvested sabbatical. Primarily for reasons of precedence, he was unwilling to pursue this option, which, while it is disappointing to me, I accept. The purpose of this note is twofold. First, I would like to thank you for making this company the great place it is today, and for giving me the opportunity to have a great career here. I will forever look upon my nine plus years with Enron fondly. Second, I would like to ask you as the administrator of the 1997 Long Term Incentive Plan to allow me to explore opportunities in the venture capital community without triggering non-compete provisions with regard to future payouts. I very much enjoyed my brief role in venture capital, and have some very good contacts in that area here in New York. Since NetWorks decided to cease operations in that business earlier in the year, I should not think that Enron would view anything I might do there as competitive, especially if I were not working directly in the energy space with an Enron competitor. At present, I am planning to spend my time at least through the summer enjoying, and travelling with, my family. I have nothing planned professionally as of yet, but wanted to take the opportunity to drop you this note while I might still be viewed positively (I hope that's not too presumptuous!). Please let me know your thoughts on this non-compete provision as I would not wish for anything to be awkward for us going forward.

Mona L Petrochko 08/24/2000 09:45 PM cc: West GA, Edward Jennifer Chris Greg Harold G Martin Douglas James M Gary Dennis Roger David Paul Marcie Mary Harry James D Richard Peggy Karen Mark Steven J Tim I attended Cmmr. Wood's two-day hearing on Wholesale Markets, which concluded today (8/24) in San Diego. Three Commissioner's were present (Wood, Lynch and Neeper) with Duque and Bilas participating by phone. Administrative Law Judge Wetzel was present and a transcript was taken. The quasi-legislative hearing was the beginning of a record developed for the investigation into the workings of wholesale/retail markets. This session focused on Wholesale markets. There will be subsequent sessions on retail issues, market structure and other related issues in the future. My conclusion from this session is that Wood is looking for support for increasing regulatory intervention in the market. Dan Larcamp, Director of the Office of markets, Tariffs and Rates, FERC, was present. He relayed FERC's concern of this matter and a desire to hold hearings in San Diego. He also relayed that Hoecker held a press conference announcing the opening of a 206 investigative proceeding into the operation of the wholesale markets in California, which carried with it refund authority. The format of the hearing was to respond to pre-filed questions developed by Wood/Lynch. Each member of the panel would respond to the questions and any questions posed by the Commissioners, the Judge or the CPUC Attorney. No questions were posed by members of the audience. Yesterday's panel of academics were comprised of: 1. Dr. Timothy Duane-UC Berkley 2. Dr. William Hogan-Harvard 3. Dr. Frank Wolak-Stanford (ISO Market Surveillance Committee) 4. David Marcus-Energy Consultant for the Coaltion of Utility Employees 5. Dr. Gene Coyle 6. Dr. Jean-Michel Glachant, Universite Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne The panel was asked to speak as individuals and not on behalf of any institutions they may represent. While the purpose of the panel seemed to be to determine that market power was being exercised and that prices were too high and therefore not just and reasonable, the panelist stopped short of blaming generators and market participants in behaving illegally. The concensus generally was that market power did exist at various times, but the mere existence did not constitute bad behavior. None, with the exception of Dr. Wolak who is in the process of doing a study using recent data as part of his role for the Market Surveillance Committee, had done a study. There was some discussion, though not much, of the monopsony power of the utilities. I think ultimately the group conceded that scarcity of supply amplified concerns about the exercise of market power, as even the increase in gas costs did not fully explain the recent spikes. Wolak believes that encourage utilities to enter into forward purchases will reduce the exercise of real-time market power. Hogan seemed to be there with Sempra's interests in mind. He continued to promote expansion of the ISO's abilities to dispatch load as well as maintain system reliability. There was alot of discussion about forward purchase ability for utilities so as to be less subject to volatile market prices. The concerns were also discussed about the appropriateness of a distribution utility making purchasing decisions on behalf of its customers. This included discussion of separation of these functions and the default provider role. Most everyone agreed that rolling back to a regulated market was not feasible without raising other major and serious concerns, however there seemed to be support for some interim measures where cost-of-service regulation may be a good idea and that was during peak periods. All agreed that a demand response, and price signals, are important in the long-run, although not to the extent currently experienced in San Diego. Today's panel included representatives from SDG&E, SCE and PG&E, TURN, UCAN and ORA. While yesterday's panel maintained objectivity as to whether or not generators were exercising market power to the detriment of the system, today's panel made no bones about the generators being to blame. SCE/PG&E indicated their need for relief for recovery of market costs in excess of the rate freeze. SDG&E was still on the hot seat for their inaction in hedging any of their supply. SDG&E brought up their failed PBR proposal and ORA and UCAN thought that that may be one way to incent the utility to be more responsible with their purchases. UCAN discussed the Governor's direction and the potential for putting rate caps into affect for residential and small commercial. He mentioned that C&I customers are experience difficulties as well. TURN raised the need for cost-based bid caps and cost-based peaking contracts. Mike Florio, TURN, urged against any further divestitute of assets and alleged market concentration on those assets that had been divested. In fact, TURN urged the Commission to seek legislation to clarify the Commission's authority to order retention of assets. Neeper urged that part of the solution should be changing the current requirement to use the PX as the only authorized exchange, although TURN disagreed.

Good new - The Williamson Act passed the Senate 34-1, It should be heard at the assembly Saturday or Monday if it is not redirected to a Committee hearing. 2. There was a long meeting with Ducheny with regards to AB 970. The enviro's boycotted, they want to draft a bill with Keeley. Labor was obstructionist - they wanted to gut all the expediting siting language with regards to all facilities except for the peaking plants. Rate Cap related bills 1. The Edison Language on Rate Stabilization may not go anywhere. Edison has not found an author because of the efforts of Enron and others lobbying against it. Furthermore there are signs that Gov. Davis opposes it. 2. The Governor's office has issued a proposed language for a rate cap bill. The language however is not available as of yet. It may be released today or tomorrow. SDG&E has shown concerns over the content of the bill. They seem to think that it is worse than initially proposed by the Governor in his press release. The bill includes retroactive rate caps through 6/1/00. The rate cap could reflect Wood's rate cap proposal (6.5 cts cap on the energy component The bill does not specify who or how the costs associated with the cap will be recovered. (The reasoning is that UDCs will be more cautious in their procurement if there is uncertainty on who is responsible for the costs.) All of this is speculative. We hope to see the actual language soon. 3. Enron has been working with the Republican leadership to promote a rate cap proposal similar to the amended language we have proposed for AB2290. The bill focuses only on SDG&E customers and our major principals are the following. The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to residential and small commercial customers, plus specific institutions that have a significant public role, such as schools and hospitals. The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to the period ending December 31, 2001. The Interim Rate Cap must be structured so that any undercollection is eventually recovered from the same customers who benefit from the lower rates provided by the rate cap.",Neutral,2000

Kaiser Aluminum International Inc. (""Kaiser International"") has a big market presence in the UK and MG has significant forward financial and physical metals positions with Kaiser International which I believe are quite out-of-the-money. Can we find out whether or not we can perform a bilateral, affiliate NETTING AGREEMENT between Kaiser International and Kaiser Aluminum with MG and EPMI? If the UK is going to continue to do short-term new metals business with Kaiser International and if we can get comfortable with metals forward positions that are OTM, we would like to use this position and leverage off of it for trading liquidity in the states. Secondly, does the netting need to just pertain to global financial business or can it include physical as well? If possible, I'd like to see if you and a UK trading attorney can speak about the overall concept and briefly address any UK and domestic law conflicts. Please call when you have a opportunity to discuss. ENA is looking to enter into a power swap for June '01. I'm not sure if this concept is achievable, and if it is, in the time frame we're facing. However, if we can't do a June swap, then we'll try for a July swap. Regards, Tracy",Neutral,2001

The Senate adjourned early Saturday morning, closing out both the regular session and the second extraordinary session. The Assembly adjourned a few hours later, closing the regular session, but NOT the second extraordinary session. The Legislature's options: 1) The Governor calls them back in two weeks, they continue with the second extraordinary session, and pick up where they left off with the bills they were working on up till Saturday morning. 2) The Governor calls them back in two weeks, the Assembly ends the second extraordinary session, they begin a third extraordinary session, and the bills that were left hanging on Saturday morning must start the process from scratch. However, they can pass a ""waiver,"" which effectively would allow them to start a 3rd session AND then pick up where they left off on Saturday morning. 3) The Governor calls them back in two weeks and the Legislature meets briefly and shuts down without doing anything, i.e., the Govenor can call them back, but he can't make them vote. In short, the Legislature has a significant amount of discretion to do what they please. Where to from here? Through its actions on Saturday morning, the Senate has sent a strong signal to Davis that the Senate is not inclined to vote out an Edison bailout that differs from the version it passed prior to leaving for summer recess last July. Just before closing down on Saturday, the Senate also passed a resolution declaring that ""...the condition of electric service in California no longer consitutes a 'sudden and severe energy shortage'"" and ""...that the state of emergency proclaimed by the Governor on January 17, 2001, is at and end."" The resolution seems to send an additional signal that the Senate does not see any great need to bail out Edison. The Assembly did not pass the resolution, however. Given the Senate's view, and the open hositility between Davis and Burton, Davis' only remaining option seems to be to threaten the Senate with vetoes unless the Senate first passes the Davis' Edison bill. It is unclear at this time whether Davis would play it that tough. With the Legislature gone, the action turns to the PUC, where a vote on DA suspension is scheduled for Thursday. We are working with customers and providers to stop DA from being suspended, or at a minimum, to ensure that any suspension date is not retroactive. Finally, Burton held a news conference this morning at which he said: Burton and Senator Bowen (Bowen's been taking the lead on DA in the Senate) will ask the California PUC to do a study on how DA can be retained without ""adversely affecting homeowners and small businesses."" He doesn't know why ""the Governor would waste taxpayers' money to hold a special session."" With all the troubled businesses in California right now, he doesn't know why the State would bail Edison out and not the others. If all this sounds ridiculous, it is. We'll report back with additional information as we get it. Best, Jeff",Neutral,2001

We would like to start this process with a conference call on Monday March 5, 2001 at 3:00 p.m. Please see call in information below. (It is not necessary for any consultants to participate in the Monday call.) This conference call will be followed by an in-person meeting here at IEP on Thursday March 8, 2001 at 2:00 p.m. If you are interested in participating on this committee please signify that with an e-mail response to this message. For those planning on participating on the conference call we will send out the agenda on Monday. During that conference call we will also set the agenda for the Thursday in person meeting. During the Thursday meeting we would also like to move to select a permanent chairperson.

Sent: Monday, September 10, 2001 4:50 PM Jim -- my understanding is that ENA Legal is going to take care of hiring the outside counsel (Sam Behrends) on this.

I'll let you know as soon as I have more info. Sent: Monday, September 10, 2001 4:29 PM Susan -- Please put in an RCR to discuss ASAP (probably next week). I think that the key issue involves the inclusion of financial transactions. Need a solid message from industry that this is inappropriate - which EPSA members are filing this info? Jim Sent: Friday, September 07, 2001 4:19 PM Today's EPSA conference call was well-attended and the participants seemed to agree that the status quo (i.e., making relatively limited paper filings of transactional information) is much preferable to the more extensive electronic posting that FERC is proposing. Admittedly, though, some of what FERC is proposing seems to be justified -- for example, the FPA requires every public utility to show rates and charges in the form prescribed by the Commission, which gives the Commission a lot of latitude. The basic conclusion was that EPSA's filing should make the point that FERC should be able to find a way to meet its Section 205-c obligations in a way that is not potentially commercially damaging to market participants. Also, FERC may be overreaching in requesting data that does not pertain to physical transactions. Additionally, there was some discussion of requesting confidential treatment of the information to be posted. EPSA will draft comments with the assistance of outside counsel, Dickstein Shapiro. A draft will be circulated and if any of you are not on the EPSA distribution list I will make sure you get a copy. Elizabeth and others, we have already discussed the importance of Enron weighing in separately in this proceeding. Since comments are due October 5, I believe at this point it would be prudent to call our outside counsel so that we can begin the drafting process. SSL",Neutral,2001

Write back Sent: Monday, October 15, 2001 2:51 PM Hey girl!! When I opened up this e-mail I said, ""Wow""!! It has to be EXTREMELY SLOW to get an e-mail like this!! Girl you are so-oo crazy. Sounds like you were a true FOX last night. Thank goodness you weren't in Chicago, looking like that!! The outfit sounds cute. Doesn't it make you feel good when the kids admire you. I can relate to that warm, fuzzy feeling brought on by your child. I can't wait to see the pictures. I'm sorry to hear that you're having plumbing problems. Did Todd call a plumber last night? I wonder how expensive that job will be? I'm looking forward to rehearsal also. Where was V. Michael on Sunday? I was wondering where Samantha had been myself. I heard that she sang with the women 5th Sunday. I was thinking she had gone over to Higher Dimensions with Sis. Kaye. We need to visit that church and see what all the hupla is. Do you have a hat for next Sunday? After church, I went home & cooked spaghetti. Steve's cousin was giving a small family b-day gathering for his mom. I didn't want to go, but Steve asked me to. On the way home, he wanted to talk. He told me how much he loved me, etc... Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. It all sounded so familiar. He also apologized for the big blow up on Saturday. He even apologized to Siera for the things she heard. She told him that she didn't like the way he treated her mom. She really expressed herself. I was proud of her for speaking up. She was very respectful, but got her point across. I felt like he was only trying to make peace because he wanted some you know what. He wasn't getting off that easy. When we got in bed, he wanted to snuggle up under me. I then asked him where he had gone the other night. He immediately got an attitude. I asked again and he yelled, ""Why""! He then jumped out of the bed saying something about me questioning him as if he's 6 yrs. old. I said, ""Whatever, you've just confirmed what I feel so just go on & get out of here."" He's so-oo stupid! I'm his wife and can't ask where he's been. I should know where he is at all times. I just really don't have time for his mess. So, in what area would you like to purchase a new house? Write back. Nytasha Patrice.L.Mims @enron.com To: cc: 10/15/01 01:18 Subject: Re: Slow Day PM Hey girl, What's going on? It is truly a slow day over here. So far, I really could have taken the day off and would not have missed anything. Last night I had a date with my mother-in-law. She's a member of a book club and they had their 3rd annual literary Gala last night at the Omni Hotel. It was nice, but long. The tickets said it started at 6:00 and I got their at 6:00. The doggone ticket should have said cocktails at 6:00 and seating at 6:45. I was tired of standing around waiting to be seated. But, girl, Ms Thang felt so good last night. I felt like a million dollars in my semi-formal attire. After I left church, I went to one of my favorite stores, Chico's, and bought myself a nice dressy top to go with my floor length (not by design, I'm just not tall enough) black skirt. The top that I bought set it off so nicely. It was black, light brown and gold! I wore my rhinestone choker and my rhinestone big hoop earrings, not the ones I wear all the time, but a new pair, much mo' flashy and my black high heel sandals that show all my foot. Boy, I felt good about my appearance. When I came out of the bedroom after getting dressed, Jordan said ""Mommy.......you look pretty. Made my evening. Of course, Bozo the husband, didn't say one word. But I felt good, I even had Jordan take some pictures of me, so we'll see how those come out (smile). We have severe plumbng problems I discovered when I got back home, Todd said the septic tank is stopped up, I have no idea what that really entails, but it must of been ugly. He was pissed! Looking forward to rehearsal tomorrow night, speaking of rehearsal, I was wondering where Samantha had been, and Poiter told me yesterday that she's back in school, so that's why she's hasn't been there. How did your evening go last night? We still need to talk, maybe we'll get a chance to visit tonight. Todd already said he wasn't going to be home until around 11:00 p.m. on Mon, Tues, or Wed, of this week, due to Power Mart. I said fine, have fun. I am so bitter, I'm ready for a change too. Right now, it doesn't seem like me and the boys would be missing much. All we do is coordinate our schedules to see when we can schedule different, independent, activities. Plus, I'm ready for a new house, clean break and new environment. Oh well, talk with you later! Thanking you in advance for disregarding any and all typos! Sent: Friday, October 05, 2001 10:12 AM Hi Tricey!! How is your day going so far? Fine, I hope. I've been extremely busy. I'm glad it's Friday. Well, Siera received her report card yesterday and it's not good. I've almost cried myself into sickness. I don't know what else to do. I've prayed and given it to God, but she still struggles. We're seeking some outside tutoring right now. The 4th grade teacher at Southwest is going to tutor her. Keep her lifted up in prayer. She's pretty much given up completely. She thinks that she's dumb and that she'll be placed in special education. She wrote me a letter last night telling me to stop telling her that she's smart, because she's not. She said that she's dumb because her report card says so. That hurt me so bad. Lil' Steve's report card was excellent. He's doing a great job. The best thing we could've done for him was put him at Southwest. How's the school search going for Jordan?

Specifically this has included occasional sales of gas resulting from cashout requirements and the buying and selling of gas to maintain linepack levels. TW's sale of excess linepack gas would probably be fine. By contrast, buying gas then turning around and reselling it would be suspect as it would look too much like our unbundled merchant function. Let me know if you have further questions. Lindy Donoho 09/20/2000 04:43 PM cc: In our Plan meeting, we were discussing UAF and Operation's objective to reduce it. Operation's objective is a volumetric goal, but we are at risk for the gas price. It started me thinking about our whole fuel expense. TW's fuel expense is valued on our books at the TW systemwide index. Should TW be hedging the fuel that we burn? Jan-Aug, 2000 (acctg months) Y-T-D fuel expense is at $21MM ($2.6MM/month) at a total volume of 6.7 Bcf. This summer, with high gas prices and Gallup in service, our fuel has been ranging $3.4-3.8MM a month. Operations has objectives to minimize the fuel use, but not the price. How could we hedge our fuel used? Would we sell all the fuel retained (hedge it as high as possible) and manage our fuel expense separately through its own purchasing and hedging (as low as possible) effort? Could we have hedged some portion of our fuel usage last year for this year at $2.36 (like we hedged our excess fuel) and not be subject to the high prices we're seeing this summer? Do you think there is an opportunity here to manage our fuel expense more effectively? Susan, I think you had looked at TW's ability to buy/sell gas a few months back (when we were looking at fuel monetization). What did the FERC Order say about under what circumstances TW could buy/sell gas?",Neutral,2000

As you probably know, our employee, Barbara O'Banion, started in the position earlier this week. I will be calling Britt soon to check on Barbara's progress. On a separate note, I want to offer you our services as you and your legal team strategize your defense of the recent shareholder suits. Ad Hoc has been an integral component in staffing complex, multi-party litigation for companies of your size -- we have supplied as many as 90 temps on a single piece of litigation. We have considerable experience designing and recruiting flexible, cost-efficient teams of knowledgeable legal professionals who can handle the routine aspects of a document review, while your permanent staff works on more sophisticated matters. Likewise, as your transactional counterparts at Enron begin working on the merger's due diligence review, I hope Ad Hoc can offer its experience. We supplied the largest number of temporary lawyers and paralegals to conduct document reviews in both the El Paso/Coastal and Exxon/Mobil mergers. We were also involved in the Chevron/Texaco merger and the Waste Management buyout. Please do not hesitate to call on me at any time if I can be of assistance.

The only concern I have is the reference at the end of the first paragraph to ""the crisis grows daily with no clear resolution offering long term relief in sight.""

So I am concerned that the legislative leadership would take some umbrage at the notion that we dont see any of what they are doing as offering hope for a long term solution. Perhaps we could rephrase it to say that the piecemeal elements of positive solutions that have been discussed or offered need to be clarified and blended into a comprehensive proposal which has the following elements....and then lay out our case. Sandi, do you agree with my concerns? Otherwise the elements of the letter are fine, and track what we are trying to draft in terms of legislative language.

Sent: Friday, November 09, 2001 7:45 AM Sent: Wednesday, November 07, 2001 9:11 AM Here is an update on the state of play in Washington regarding Dabhol as the Indian PM arrives this evening: As it became apparent last week that the discussions in Delhi about the MOU were not panning out, I met with OPIC President Watson and Exec VP Connelly to bring them up to speed on the status of discussions and map out the message to be given by the Administration to the PM on his visit this week. While OPIC certainly does not have final say re the message on Dabhol they are clearly the driver within the USG and they have been very aggressive in that regard. Out of our meeting Watson sent to State and the NSC a message with the following two points: 1. the Project sponsors, the $ lenders, and OPIC and EXIM are of one mind that the negotiating time frame on Dabhol is approaching its end. If India does not act immediately it will be too late. 2. The President and this Administration needs to express its strong disappointment at the failure of the GOI to make an effort to engage on the Buyout, which needs to be negotiated within a particular $ range, subject to a simultaneous negotiation with the $ lenders. The OPIC memo was sent to State and the NSC and is now embodied in talking points for President Bush in his Friday meeting with the PM. For the last week plus I have provided daily updates to OPIC, to Larson's office at State, to the South Asia regional group and to the NSC so they know of any new developments and where we are. Yesterday afternoon I met with OPIC on the lawsuit and how that might change the talking points. At this point, President Bush will raise Dabhol in his meeting with the PM Friday. The Indian Ambassador met with the NSC yesterday to discuss the agenda and was briefed on the MOU going in. It is being considered that Larry Lindsey will discuss Dabhol in greater detail, probably with Mishra. There was some concern about prior relationship to Enron but I understand from State the lawyers have taken care of the concern. Larson is in Doha but is current on the situation and can engage if necessary. It is unfortunate he is out of town. Amb. Blackwill had dinner last night with Watson and Connelly of OPIC and claims he is on top of the issue. Last, but certainly not least, we have a meeting with the PMO Secretary Ghash (?) at 4:30 Thursday at the Indian Embassy. I do not know if we have firmly decided yet who should attend. If Jim is out as I understand he is perhaps Rob Walls and I can attend. This meeting should give us an opportunity to respond in the Washington context to the proposal that I understand is in the offing in Singapore. We will then be in a position to feed that information back into the USG so that the President's meeting with the PM reflects the current state of discussions.",Neutral,2001

This is unacceptable. Sent: Sunday, October 07, 2001 11:22 PM Fred- There are a number of issues we need to address with back office procedures immediately. We are losing money on avoidable problems and gaining a bad reputation in the market. Lets get Derek and Michelle together Tuesday afternoon. 2 of our counterparties are writing letters of complaint.. here's a sample of some of the quotes we have heard from the 10 counterparties we have added in the last 6 months. ""I shouldn't have to spend my time decomposing the invoices and confirmations you send out"" ""It has been 10 days since we traded and we haven't received a shred of paper to give us the details of the trade"" ""We are being told in a confirm something different than we are being invoiced for"" ""We did not trade 300 contracts per day, it was per month - do you guys even think before you type"" ""I am a CFO and an accountant and I can't decipher what you are trying to confirm here"" From a business dinner where a client of ours was speaking casually to large industrials and endusers. One, upon the mentioning of B2B exchanges said ""they WILL NOT ever trade on EOL again because the backoffice procedure was such a nightmare.. they couldn't rely on the accuracy or timeliness of the confirm. This was a captive client who and needs to trade... who will not show us their flow again. The latest is the most disturbing: ""we just want to do a small trade to test your system. We have heard it is a nightmare but want to see for ourselves - I mean how difficult can it be to book the purchase of 50 lots of crude"" And still 5 days later they do not have one paper to show the details, not one phone call to confirm the trade...nothing. We even warned the BO that this was a new customer and to make best eforts to make sure the process runs smoothly and efficiently. Well, clearly we failed We do not understand what is going on in the back office. Is it that they are too disconnected from our daily operations to understand how integral their accurracy is to our business? Is there too much turnover? How are they trained? Who is in charge of the ""backoffice""? There seems to be a different manager for every step of the process.. who co-ordinates all their efforts? Does anyone care? Ok.. I'll stop.. For our part, we have Michelle coming up to NY for a week in December (we wanted this to happen as soon as she started but did not work for her). We have to stop this before we lose clients (which we will). All the problems are being caused by the following: 1. Our inability to generate an accurate position report for our clients. This has already cost us money this year. Our clients do 10 trades a day.. they are constantly in and out of positions.. it is imperative that we get these right. As well, this report is our ONLY check to make sure deals are entered and entered correctly into the system. There are hundreds of books at Enron. We have postions on with dozens of them. We currenttly do not have an automated mechanism to pull deals from every book in one shot. We have to select books one by one.. this method will always result in books being ommmitted given our deal flow. Michelle is in charge of this process. We need a IT person on this yesterday. Michelle is spending most of her day verifying the validity of the report she generates. Robyn, Russell, and I check it everyday.. there are always mistakes. 2. There is a breakdown in the backoffice functions after Michelle collects the tickets we write and verbally confirms them. There is no check after they have been imput. There are ALWAYS imput errors. Michelle needs to check every deal after its entered into the system going forward. We also have NO set procedures for the bookings of deals. We have no idea where our job ends and the book admin's starts.. for non standard deals like gas dailies and swaptions we need to know the exact process from start to finish. 2a. Confirms are sent immediately after deals are entered.. what if deals are imput incorrectly? the confirm goes out anyway resulting in mass confusion at the client. Going forward, confirms need to be delayed until we can confirm that everything about the deal is correct. 2b. Invoicing.. there have been dozens of occassions where the amounts we are invoicing do not match the deals done.. 3. EOL- We are pushing hard to get counterparties on here.. we have signed Renaissance up (a 10B program fund) but I shudder to see how EOL will fair at these tasks. 4. Credit- All of our clients are margined. If deals are in the system incorrectly, the wrong MTM goes to the client.. another mis-match. We work closely with credit since we need to collect initial margin from some clients.. this amount changes daily- we need someone who can get on the phone with clients and explain these numbers through.. again, we are doing this now.",Negative,2001

Hurt by Deregulation of Utilities, California Gives Itself Lead Role By REBECCA SMITH and JOHN R. EMSHWILLER Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- In a video made for a political roast, Gov. Gray Davis, mimicking the Mafia boss in ""The Sopranos,"" complains to his therapist about Texas bad guys pushing electricity prices sky high. He vows to get tough. Soon, a Davis confederate ushers four men in 10-gallon hats into an office, shots ring out, and the aide, emerging blood-spattered, delivers the punch-line: ""Tell the governor his Reliant problem is solved."" While Gov. Davis hasn't gone that far in his fight with suppliers such as Houston-based Reliant Energy Inc., he is in other ways trying to blast his way out of the crisis. His moves are coming in rapid succession after months of criticism of the governor for inaction, and they are fast reshaping the state's electricity system. With the acquiescence of other state leaders, Gov. Davis has put California on the road to creating what amounts to a mammoth state-owned electric utility, answerable largely to the governor. Moreover, though designed to solve a short-term emergency, the governor's policies are loading consumers with obligations that could affect the economy of the most-populous state for 15 to 20 years. His actions in some ways hark back to the system of central control that preceded the disastrous 1996 foray into utility deregulation. But they aren't simply a return to the days of monopoly utilities strictly regulated by the state's Public Utilities Commission. What is emerging now is a California power colossus that operates in important ways beyond the reach of regulators or the public. Mr. Davis says his actions will ensure that Californians have a secure supply of reasonably priced electricity. ""This is not a power grab,"" the Democratic governor says in an interview. ""I had no desire to intervene. I would get out tomorrow if you would let me out. This is my least-favorite thing to do."" 'Colossal Failure' Yet in the past six months, pushed by what he calls the ""colossal failure"" of a deregulation plan hatched under his Republican predecessor, the governor has put the state deep into the power business. In January, Mr. Davis ordered the state Department of Water Resources to begin buying power in place of California's cash-strapped utilities. Since then, the state has purchased or committed to purchase $45 billion to $50 billion of electricity, with some contracts as long as 20 years. The governor has in effect seized control of the state's electricity-grid operator, the California Independent System Operator, installing his hand-picked team as board members. As its name implies, the ISO was supposed to manage the grid without favoring any one participant. Mr. Davis also is pushing to have the state buy huge chunks of the transmission system that are owned by the financially beleaguered utilities. He recently signed into law a bill that creates a state power authority, whose director will be appointed by the governor. This agency, which so far exists just on paper, could be used to build power plants and help run a state-owned transmission system. Mr. Davis says that the authority is part of what he sees as a ""hybrid"" system where public power plays an important role augmenting private enterprise in the electricity business. Reviving the Utilities Having healthy utilities is extremely important, says the governor. He adds that he has been working hard to revive the state's two biggest utilities, the Pacific Gas & Electric Co. unit of PG&E Corp. and the Southern California Edison Co. subsidiary of Edison International. But as the state's role in the electricity business has grown, the utilities don't seem as essential as they once did. This is one reason the governor has had difficulty getting a rescue package for Edison through the state legislature. The plan, among other things, calls for the state to buy Edison's transmission system for $2.76 billion and envisions the utility eventually resuming some power-buying chores. Talks over a similar rescue package for Pacific Gas failed and that utility filed for bankruptcy-law protection. With the state locking up so much of California's future power needs, legislators openly wonder whether utility-rescue efforts are worth the billions of dollars they would require. In 2003, for instance, long-term contracts will cover 90% of the state's projected buying needs. ""What does it mean for Edison to take over the role [of buying power] if the state already has signed all these contracts?"" asks State Sen. Debra Bowen, a Democrat who heads the senate's energy committee. Nonetheless, the governor says he is ""cautiously optimistic"" the legislature soon will approve an Edison rescue package. Mr. Davis has been deeply enmeshed in almost every aspect of the electricity mess this year, after having once been relatively aloof from the burgeoning crisis. The state's utility-deregulation law, which was enacted in 1996, worked fairly well until May of last year. Under the deregulation plan, the state's investor-owned utilities sold off many of their power plants to other companies and repurchased that electricity through a state-sponsored auction. Consumer rates were frozen and customers were given the option to buy electricity from nonutility retail suppliers. But tight electricity supplies and a flawed auction system led to a sharp rise in wholesale power costs. With retail rates frozen, Pacific Gas and Edison racked up multibillion-dollar deficits. In January, Mr. Davis declared an emergency and put the state into the power-buying business. Since then, he hasn't been bashful about exercising his emergency powers. When Mr. Davis couldn't get legislative permission to borrow money short-term for power purchases, he signed an executive order authorizing the state to borrow up to $5 billion from commercial lenders. That borrowing is supposed to be repaid from a roughly $13 billion municipal-bond issue, the biggest in U.S. history, scheduled for later this year. In another executive order, the governor suspended emission standards for power plants to let them run more hours during the peak-demand periods. And the state has hired a small army of energy consultants and traders. Despite such actions, some think Mr. Davis isn't being forceful enough. For example, the state senate last week passed a resolution supporting the governor's power to ""commandeer power plants"" if he deems such a step to be necessary. Mr. Davis has said he doesn't have any plans currently to take such an action. 'Crisis of Governance' The electricity mess has produced ""the most extraordinary crisis of governance we've had in California in the postwar period,"" says Bruce Cain, director of the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California at Berkeley. Mr. Cain says more power has been placed in the governor's hands and, as a result, the state has ""gotten away from the separation of powers and the checks and balances that we expect in American government."" Mr. Davis says his actions have been essential and are working. He credits the long-term power contracts with helping to cool the spot market for electricity, where prices in recent weeks have dropped sharply. In June, the state paid an average price of $167 a megawatt hour for electricity. That was down from $243 in May, though still far above the $25-to-$27 range of two years ago. But some worry about how this rush to address a short-term problem will affect the longer-term future. An economic forecast issued late last month warned that continued heavy state involvement and spending in the electricity business could produce enough of a drag on the California economy to reduce state output by a total of $90 billion by 2005 and lead to higher unemployment. ""California is at a crossroads"" between what amounts to a ""state takeover of the electricity industry"" and a more market-orient",Negative,2001

The bottom line is that: 1. The CEC significantly underestimates the outages that may occur this summer. They estimate in their 5,000 MW supply deficit for the summer that expected outages will be around 3,000MW. However, November and December saw significantly higher outage levels. (7,265 MWs) The FERC has investigated these outages and found no improprieties- just that the plants are overtaxed from running at higher than normal capacities. 2. There are a lot of uncertainties surrounding the 1,244 MWs of projected supply from rerating/restarting existing thermal and renewable projects. It is very unclear how much of this will be able to come on line by this summer, if at all. As evidenced by the e-mail I sent out this morning, local communities may be very opposed to restarting shut down units. In addition, these units are likely to be uneconomical. 3. In the existing resource pool, there are roughly 1,430 MWs of peaking or other generation units that are running up against their operating hour limitations from air quality regulations. The Governor has ordered the local air quality districts to address these restrictions, We are beginning to seem some movement; however, the US EPA has yet to weigh in on these relaxed standards. 4. The distributed generation/back-up generation capacity to make up some of the shortfall is still an unknown. While there has been some relaxing of the limitations on run hours for back-up generation at ""essential public services"" the increase in DG is expected from ""clean"" sources, not diesel emergency generators. 5.

Thanks, JMF Sent: Thursday, September 27, 2001 2:45 PM Ken, As discussed earlier, I am proposing ramping up late for the onpeak sale that Frontera made for tomorrow. If we must sell the offpeak hours required to affect a 340 mw onpeak schedule, I show that we would almost negate all profit from the sale. I am suggesting starting your ramp beginning hour ending 7 and purchasing a fixed price swap from Enron for the short generation. Basically, you sold the preschedule for $21 and we would fix your price for hours ending 7-11 at $20. The benefit in this swap would be: hedge against floating price lock in $1 profit on sale for short portion of the schedule, increasing revenues avoid losing approximately $10k on selling ramping schedule - $4 is an optimistic real time sales price at this point, however, I used this in the analysis. Please let me know what you think. Enron will be offically rolling this swap product out to all of our service customers. I think this would be a good fit your company and I would like to try this for Friday's run.

Re: Gas Implied Volatility Smile,john.arnold@enron.com,sharad.agnihotri@enron.com,"Wed, 4 Apr 2001 13:28:00 -0700 (PDT)",<26991437.1075857635275.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"unfortunately, mathematical analysis of skew is extremely hard to do. the question is why does skew exist and does the market do a proper job of correcting for violations of the black scholes model. in my mind, there are three big reasons for skew. one is that the assumption of stochastic volatility as a function of price level gets violated. commodities tend to have long range trading ranges that exist due to the economics of supply and elasticity of the demand curve. nat gas tends to be relatively stable when we are in that historical pricing environment. however, moving to a different pricing regime tends to bring volatility. an options trader wants to be long vol outside the trading range, believing that a breakout of the range leads to volatility while trying to find new equilibrium. supports a vol smile theory. in addition, in some commodities realized vol is a function of price level. nat gas historically is more volatile at $5 than at $4 and more volatile at $4 than $3. thus there has been a tendency for all calls to have positive skew and all puts except weenies to have negative skew. the market certainly trades this way as vol has a tendency to come off in a declining market and increase in a rising market. to test, regress 15 day realized vol versus price level and see if there is any correlation. second reason is heptocurtosis, fatter tails than lognormal distribution predicts. supports vol smile theory. easy to test how your market compares by plotting historical one day lognormal returns versus expected distribution. third, is just supply and demand. in a market where spec players are bearish, put skew tends to get bid as vol players require more insurance premium to add incremetal risk to the book. if you have a neutral view towards market, or believe that market will come off but in an orderly fashion, enron can take advantage of our risk limits by selling more expensive insurance. crude market tends to have strong put skew and weak call skew as customer business in options is nearly all one way: producer fences. if you believe vol is stochastic in the region of prices where the fence strikes are, can be profitable to take other side of trade. if you want to discuss further give me a call 4-6 pm houston time. hope this helps, john Sharad Agnihotri 04/04/2001 12:44 PM cc: John, Mike I work for the London Research team and am looking at some option pricing problems for the UK gas desk.

Within weeks, the floor was deserted and virtually all trading occurred electronically. I still trade on the exchange because we have credit issues with individuals and certain hedge funds that limit the trading we can do with them direct.

You stated that you spent most of your time on the phone with Traders in New York. When you talk to the traders, do you try to steer them towards Enron Online, or are you doing trading outside of Enron Online? I think the underlying question that I am asking, is: Is Enron Online meant to facilitate a gas trader's job, or is it meant to bypass traders completely. Thanks again for your time and for dinner.

Printer-friendly version By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators only have the authority to order refunds for about a third of the $9 billion California Gov. Gray Davis claims energy companies have overcharged the state in the 12 months to May 2001, documents from the state's wholesale market operator show. Of the total, $2.9 billion came from the May-September period the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has said it can't act on, and $2.8 billion from the October-May period is attributable to municipal utilities over which FERC lacks jurisdiction, according to documents from the California Independent System Operator. That leaves just $3.3 billion in alleged overcharges that FERC could potentially order refunded - far less than the $9 billion Davis seeks. Talks between generators and state officials to settle billions of dollars in unpaid bills and issues of overcharging began Monday. Curtis Wagner, the FERC administrative law judge presiding over the talks, has said California will likely see refunds from generators, but far less than the $9 billion Davis expects. Davis said Sunday California is going to Washington, D.C., ""with one goal, and that is to bring back $9 billion."" Nearly half that amount is attributable to municipal utilities, the ISO documents show. The ISO said the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, for example, overcharged California $75 million between May and October. David Freeman, the governor's chief energy adviser and the former general manager of the LADWP, said the agency didn't overcharge the state, but conceded it profited by selling spare power to the ISO. Davis adviser Nancy McFadden said the state needs FERC to lay the groundwork for the state to seek refunds from public utilities by ordering refunds from corporate energy suppliers. But during a conference call Sunday with reporters, McFadden and Davis press secretary Steve Maviglio couldn't explain how the governor would go about getting refunds from companies whose wholesale power prices aren't regulated by FERC. Davis testified before the U.S. Congress last week that generators overcharged the state $9 billion and that FERC should order the refunds. State Sen. Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, has asked for an investigation into Davis's testimony, saying the figures were based on ""shaky calculations."" To come up with its conclusions, the ISO compared hourly market prices received by sellers to an estimate of market prices that could have been expected under competitive market conditions. The ISO established a benchmark for what it determined was competitive - at times about $125 per megawatt-hour to $200/MWh, a fraction of actual prices in the market - based on the cost of natural gas and compliance with air-quality rules. The ISO, however, typically used the price of gas at California's northern border, according to the documents. Generators paid a higher price for the fuel in Southern California, raising the cost of making electricity. The ISO also used reports of earnings by the state's ""Big Five"" power suppliers during 2000 - earnings that for some quadrupled - to draw the conclusion that generators overcharged the state, according to the documents. The ISO attributed high power prices in part to the state's three largest utilities' failure to buy the power they needed in advance, leaving the grid operator to pick up the shortfall at the last minute, according to the documents. The ISO alleges the following companies overcharged the state by the listed amounts between May 2000 and February: American Electric Power Service Corp.

SB 28x (Sher/Battin) makes various changes to the siting process including many IEP-sponsored proposals. As you will recall, two new provisions were added to the bill at the last minute before going to the Assembly Floor dealing with both retrofit schedules and environmental dispatch of generating facilities. Per the direction from IEP member companies, IEP has decided not to negotiate on the environmental dispatch issue. If the provision remained in the bill, IEP would continue to push the Republicans to hold their opposed position. We were, however, given the authority to negotiate on the retrofit issue as long as we were only talking about facilities that already have retrofit requirements. I will be faxing out the agreed upon language which in essence says the ARB shall set a schedule for the completion of any mandated retrofits. It does not expand the authority of the air districts and ARB to mandate retrofits under existing law. The schedule would require completion of the retrofits by July 1, 2004 or such later date as the ISO determines is necessary to maintain reliability. With these amendments, including some clean-up language, SB 28x will be voted-on on the Assembly floor on Monday and go to the Senate for concurrence on Tuesday. The final version will include the following IEP-sponsored proposals: ? Conforming the timing of offsets for power plants to Clean Air Act requirements ? Substituting CEQA-style hearings for the trial-like proceedings of the CE= C ? Streamlining the permit process for the modernization of existing power plant sites ? Giving consideration to the positive environmental impacts of a proposed project. ? Improving the timeliness and coordination of state and local agency review. ? Extending the current deadlines for the expedited review process established in AB 970. Since SB 28x is only a first step in making changes to the siting process, IEP member should now be thinking about what is next. IEP proposals still on the table include: ? Permitting local agencies to make zoning changes or other decisions for power plants contingent upon CEC CEQA Compliance ? Giving deference to other state and regional agencies ? Easing the threshold for override of local land use requirements. ? Making the ISO responsible for determining interconnection requirements -- Bad news on the =01&California First=018 issue quickly followed the good= news. The CEC staff analysis which said the State can't require builders of new power plants to sell electricity here, even as a trade-off for expedited permitting, was countered by another staff analysis that says the state can= . Both documents cannot be obtained due to attorney-client privilege. This issue is coming to a head next week with a decision pending by the CEC to include a California First clause on the approval of an expedited AES power plant project. AB 60x (Hertzberg), which ties to the siting process the requirement that a developer enter into a contract to sell power to specified California entities, is still poised to be heard in the Senate Energy committee. IEP members company lobbyist should continue to lobby against this measure regardless of the CEC=01,s decision on AES, although our arguments are definitely strengthened if the addition of the clause at the CEC is denied. -- IEP has finalized negotiations with Senator Burton=01,s office on amendm= ents attempting to solve our problem with the eminent domain provision in SB 6x (Burton), which is the State Power Authority measure. Attached is a copy o= f the bill in PDF form. The agreed upon language, which clarifies that the Authority=01,s purpose is to supplement existing generation activities, can= be found on pages 6-7 (Section 3310), 13 (Section 3341.1) and 16-17 (Section3352). Considering the inflammatory remarks made by Senator Burton in the press lately regarding seizing generation assets, this was most likely the best we could get. -- The first of Senator Dunn=01,s hearings with the Senate Select Committee= to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Market occurred this week. This week and next week=01,s topics will be to go over previous investigati= ons into market power. The committee heard or will be hearing testimony from: Frank Wolak, Chairman Market Surveillance Committee, CAISO; Eric Hildebrandt, Manager Market Monitoring, CAISO; and, Elaine Howle, State Auditor. -- The Assembly Electricity Oversight Subcommittee met this week and focused on the issue of natural gas collusion. Testifying before the committee were representatives from Dynegy and El Paso, commenting on the rise of natural gas prices and whether illegal market manipulation and collusion occurred. The subcommittee plans on putting together a package o= f bills related to natural gas issues, which would be the culmination of the committee=01,s hearings over the last two months. This package will be up = for consideration first by the whole special Assembly Energy committee. -- Governor Davis came out this week supporting the construction of the Calpine Metcalf Energy Center, the 600-megawatt power plant proposed for th= e San Jose region.

The batting, pitching, and bench coaches for the Mets held a press conference earlier today. They were joined by members of the Major League Players Union. ""We meant to hit those pitches from the Yankee pitchers,"" said the Mets batting coach. ""We were confused by the irregularities of the pitches we received and believe we have been denied our right to hit."" One claim specifically noted that a small percentage of the Mets batters had intended to swing at fast balls, but actually swung at curve balls. It was clear that these batters never intended to swing at curve balls, though a much higher percentage were not confused by the pitches. Reporters at the press conference pointed out that the Mets had extensively reviewed film of the Yankees pitchers prior to the World Series and had in fact faced the Yankees in inter-league play earlier in the year. ""The fact remains that some of the pitches confused us and denied us of our right to hit,"" said the Mets batting coach. ""The World Series is not over yet and the Yankees are celebrating prematurely.""Major League Baseball has reviewed the telecast of all the World Series games and recounted the balls and strikes called by the umpires of each game. ""While some of the strikes called against the Mets were, in fact, balls, there were not enough of them to change the outcome of the World Series,"" the commissioner said. Another portion of the Mets legal claim stated that, based on on-base percentage, the Mets had actually won the World Series, regardless of the final scores of the games. ""It's clear that we were slightly on-base more often than the Yankees,"" said a Mets spokesman. ""The World Series crown is rightly ours.""The manager of the Mets has remained in relative seclusion, engaging in some light jogging for exercise.

On the EECC long list, #13 (501D5A) is not slated to be used on an an ENA/Electrocities project, as LM's are now being considered (guess you knew this). I believe Blue Dog (#14 on EECC list) has been an EECC deal, not an ENA deal; I don't know about the Choc. Bayou or Central Iowa projects listed as ENA projects. Maybe these are sleepers.

This language has been included in the attached draft. My goal, however optimistic, is to execute the risk policy by the end of today. Activity is picking up dramatically and the fine line is getting further blurred each passing day. Therefore, I need to know ASAP if there are any problems with the draft as written.

Development fee is a commercial question. This will need to be vetted with Herman if we go with it. Personally, I'd skip it and push to sign next week. 2. I have a call in to Dale. 3. No LLC. Kathleen will handle. The closer the creation is to the signing of the letter, the better, taking into account the time required to get the docs back and set up. Someone needs to name it. We should also look at a minimal list of officers. 4. I don't have the attachment in front of me, so I will have to look it up. I'll get back to you. The concept is that ENA is only responsible for changes in the amounts owed to GE as of the closing date. I thought the language was awkward, and tried to make it more clear, but obviously failed! As soon as I get the break out contract from Dale we can check on the definitional questions. It SHOULD be the same as in the CA breakout contract with GE, but I won't make that assumption. Drop dead date on put/call Dec. 2002. 5. This needs to be discussed with Ben. 6. This should be set up as a new matter, since these aren't the Blue Dog turbines.

Based on our meeting, Carolyn was going to make certain revisions based on the answers to the questions below and certain other items we raised during our meeting. Nevertheless, your input is required on the following: 1. We have discussed eliminating the payment of a development fee, which if Delta / Panda were to breach its obligations prior to the funding of the Escrow would be non-refundable and serve as a form of liquidated damages. Commercially the inclination is to avoid that fee, we need to confirm that approach. 2. We need to interface with Dale Rasmussen on the status of the break out contract and how quickly it can be incorporated into the form of Facility Agreement that would be part of our transaction. 3. Have we established an LLC that will be sold for this project. 4. Please see Caroline's questions 6, 7 and 13 below. 5. Please see faxes that I left on your chair on the broker issue and whether we need to respond in writing. Sheila Tweed's position was not to. 6. John asked whether K&S should open a separate subfile or include the time charged within the Blue Dog file?

Instead of creating such a system, which apparently turned out to be mostly a manual system anyway, ECS is going to pay us a monthly fee to monitor CD's system peaks ourselves and decide when we need to get off line. The load management service has to do with operational management of the load we place on CD's electric system, and is not a jurisdictional gas transportation or storage service.

Can you describe the process and timing for filing a project update? Thanks, Kay ""Duncan, Allyson"" on 08/10/2000 09:45:11 AM cc: ""Fine, Jonathan"" I inadvertently ended the sentence with a comma. The point I was making was that if it were necessary to negotiate an additional delivery point, NCNG would probably demand concessions such as an extension of the contract period. Hopefully, since we are only talking about a high pressure tap, NCNG will have less leverage. Jeffrey and I did talk about amending the application some time ago; he expressed the concern that the description of the generators might be misleading unless either more or less data were supplied, and he suggested describing them more generally. I think he was confortable with the fact that the CPCN will be reviewed by electrical engineers who understand the generators described without the elaboration he thought necessary. One of the problems with amending the application is that you run the risk that the Commission will adjust the time frames for intervention, etc., accordingly. If you want to revise the description of the equipment, it would be less dangerous to file a project update. Sent: Wednesday, August 09, 2000 6:48 PM Allyson, Thank you for the email. It seems to stop in mid sentence, so I was wondering if maybe something got deleted? We have an interest in having the application for the CPCN amended to be less specific on the equipment we will be using. I believe Jeffrey may have mentioned this to you before. We would like to follow up with that now, unless there is some significant problem with it. Thank you, Kay ""Duncan, Allyson"" on 08/07/2000 02:27:23 PM cc: ""Fine, Jonathan"" There would seem to me to be two questions--the threshold one is whether the site is within Rocky Mount's service territory. If it is, then what obligation does NCNG have with respect to the construction of a delivery point. I haven't reviewed the annexation statutes yet, but based on my initial reading of the Service Area Territory Agreement between Rocky Mount and NCNG, once annexed the site would come within Rocky Mount's purview to serve, and, although a ""mutually agreeable"" delivery point would have to be negotiated, NCNG would at least have to negotiate that in good faith. The January 13, 1992 Service Area Territory Agreement gives Rocky Mount the right to distribute natural gas within the city's incorporated limits as well as a specified area outside the incorporated limits. The contract goes on to provide that should any part of that perimeter be annexed into the city, ""the respective rights of the parties as to service in any such portion shall be determined by applicable case law and the General Statutes of North Carolina. . ."" The contract further provides that absent an order of the NCUC to the contrary, NCNG agrees that Rocky Mount has the right to serve all end users within the ""aforementioned"" area--presumably referring to the annexed area, although the agreement is not a model of clarity. So, at least based on this language, Rocky Mount's right to serve arguably tracks its incorporated limits, whatever they might be. (Jonathan and I are looking at annexation law to see what else might be lurking out there). The 1992 Service agreement provides, In Article IV, provides that points of devliery for all natural gas purchased or transported under the agreement with NCNG shall be ""at the following locations and other stations added at mutually agreeable locations in the future. . ."" In the Third Amendment to the Natural Gas Service Agreement, dated March 10, 1997, new language and delivery points are negotiated upon, but the principle is still included that other stations may be added at ""mutually agreeable locations in the future."" The question which then arises is what Rocky Mount would have to give in exchange. In the 1997 agreement, Rocky Mount agreed to an extention of terms of the of ten years, until December 6,",Neutral,2000

In Dave's experience, that is a nonstarter. Apparently, a bunch of utilities, including us through Dave, have even formed a coalition to try to figure out how to get the railroads to be more cooperative. If the RR owns its ROW outright (which many of the old railroads do out west) we might be able to condemn an easement by getting a FERC certificate. In other words, the RR would be treated just like any other landowner. If we did that, Dave thinks BNSF would treat it as a declaration of war. Since our lines cross or parallel BNSF right of way all over the place from Topock to Duluth, that would be foolish. I swore Sinclair to secrecy and told him what part of the world I was interested in and he thought we could probably stitch together private ROW without too much pain. If the RR option doesn't pan out, we may want to suggest to Tino and Dennis that our ROW people can handle this. Assuming we can't come up with some magic contact with the RR, I propose that, at the appropriate time, we tell Dennis and Tino that the last 7 or 8 miles of ROW should be flagged as a potential problem that Enron can help resolve once we decide to go forward. Other than the BNSF issue, I don't think we have any specific ""to dos"" or any specific comeback date to Dennis and Tino. So what do you guys think should happen next? DF",Neutral,2000

This is what he said: Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg is going to introduce a bill tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. which will contain many of the same elements in ABX 1, minus the 5.5. This will be a more comprehensive bill which will address arrearage, securitization and include some type of a stop loss mechanism among other things. It is unclear whether or not the bill will be voted on tomorrow or held until Monday, but there will be a hearing at 2:00 p.m. SBX 1 will probably be heard tomorrow as well, although it is not clear what action if any the Senate Energy Committee will take. There are ongoing discussions about the state creating a transmission corporation to operate but not own the transmission system. There are ongoing discussions about allowing DWR to buy existing block forward contracts, however the courts today issued a stay to prevent SCE or the PX from taking any actions on the contracts until at least February 2. There are ongoing discussions about issuing ratepayer bonds in place of the full faith and credit of the state which was absent from the DWR RFB. Sempra requested that the legislature repeal Utilities Code Section 355.2 which prevents IOUs from buying outside the PX. Other items which arose today: We spent the day meeting with legislators regarding expedited siting. The response was positive, including from Senator Byron Sher who is the key environmentalist in the legislature. Our initial focus has been on the trouble with getting air credits. Governor Davis held a press conference moments ago where he indicated that the average bid price for the DWR RFB is 6.9. I will forward the press release in the morning. I have attached a press release from Governor Davis regarding the new ISO board which includes information on the new members. vsite%2fpressrelease%2f200101%2f20010124a01024.html&sTitle=GOVERNOR+DAVIS+ ANNOUNCES+FIRST+MEETING+OF+NEW+ISO+BOARD&sCatTitle=Press+Release&iOID=13102",Neutral,2001

I'm sorry I've been so bad about staying in touch while you've been stuck in those Rocky Mountain highs and lows of life. It sounds like things are going really well though (Rocky Mountain ""highs"") and that you've made it through most of the tumult of moving to a new place (Rocky Mountain ""lows""). Amber tells me every time she talks to Marky, her man of the hour, he mentions how they've got to get together with you when she comes to town - which will be on next Friday, whoo hoo, party! I'm so mad that she gets to go and I don't, being that I am not, like her, in my eighth year of college and therefore do not enjoy such things as ""Spring Break Mania"" anymore. And Monica tells Marky who tells Amber who tells me that she'd love to hang out with you more often. It sounds like you guys had a ball at dinner, eh? So you've got options, girlfriend, which is worlds more than I can say for my life at the mo'. It pretty much consists of working, eating, and sleeping. I'm definitely looking into that SAD mental disorder thing, because I think it's got me in its clutches. But the recent abundance of sunshine has brought me enough renewed energy to start thinking about life after winter. We're doing lots of gardening, cooking, and decorating at the house - it's like having three Martha Stewarts all working together, only slightly less stylish , immensely less efficient, and drunk. Other than that, I've been trying to organize and simplify my life - taking care of mounds of paperwork, paying off debts, sorting out all those nagging little post-it notes that plague me constantly and demand my attention in vain. I'm actually starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel, like maybe I could buy a car or take a trip in a few months, or even buy a SECOND pair of shoes, but let's not get wild and crazy just yet. So I heard Dad and Laura are on their way to your neck of the woods with an automobile. That is, in the immortal words of the guys in ""Dude, where's my car?"", SWEET... DUDE! You are stoked. I bet that's a major load off - just make sure to keep your finances in check and not get in over your head. Take it from one who knows. I'm seriously looking into buying an old beater car; but then I start fantasizing about the Audi A4 Quattro, and suddenly $30,000 doesn't seem like a bad price for becoming ultimately cool. Lately I've been doing a lot of research into self-improvement measures. I just applied for post-baccalaureate status at U of O, so I can start taking economics and poli sci classes online. (I just got my new FREE computer from work!) I'm also studying for the GRE, and pretty soon here I'm going to get serious about graduate school. I think I've decided on international studies and/or economics, depending on how well I like the classes I take. I've found my dream program at Johns Hopkins University in Washington, D.C. It's a two-year Masters of International Studies program that begins in Washington and ends in.....are you sitting down?.....Bologna, Italy! Holy shit, does it get more perfect? Apparently it's like the premiere training ground for government officials, according to my friend Andy who laughed forcefully in my face when I told him I wanted to get into it. But I figure, I'm not getting any younger, and I don't want any regrets, so I'm goin' for it, dude. As for the love life, it's nonexistant, which is why I'm putting so much energy into the self-improvement area of my life. I figure as long as I'm having no fun with boys I might as well be beefing up my net value. By the time they come around again, the eligible pool will have shrunk to 1 in 100 million. Whatever. Anyway, now that I've written you the longest paragraph of my life, I must retreat to my work duties. Then it's off for a thrilling tour of Portland via Tri-Met. Molly's making me dinner tonight in exchange for a finished resume. It's only taken her 3 years to compile the information for it, so this one should be a doozy. Hey, if you can ever make it home for a weekend, you should come at the end of May - David Gray is coming to the Schnitzer, and it's going to be fabulous! I'll buy your concert ticket if you can convince Dad to get your plane ticket. Call me soon if you can, or I'll call this weekend. Take care and I miss you! Love, Kate Anna Symes on 03/13/2001 02:55:09 PM cc: Hey Lady! What do you think you're doing? I haven't talked to you in way too long. You have to update me on the sitch! I am going on a date with a guy I met while out with Monica last weekend. He was our waiter and he looks like Chandler Bing, only Monica kept calling him Chanandler Bong (did you see that episode when they had to name who the TV Guide came to?). She is so fun! I was so glad to get out of my apartment/away from my roommate. And now I have a date, so I'm excited. I'm still in contact with Mr. Colorblind, but we've had the friends talk so it's been really cool. In fact, he's nicer to me now than he was before! Anyway, that's crazy news about Mom's house! I guess no more crashing at her house when I go home. How are your roommates? Your seattle boyfriend? Your job? Write me with the goods, woman. I am getting a car in two weeks and I am more excited than any car-buyer has ever been. My job is great, although i think I'm getting scoliosis from bad posture in an uncomfortable chair all day. Nothing else is happening. Are you going out for St. Patrick's Day? I have to work, but there's a big outdoor thing downtown that I might go to afterwards. Okay, must go work. Call me though! I miss you! Love, Anna",Positive,2001

The weighted average trade price via Enron Online will reflect a price of $15.76, but coupled with the volume not transacted online, this price was estimated to be a $16.00 midpoint. Specificially the following trades were transacted over the telephone: Nicor Gas Company $18.16 20,000 Via ANR @ Hampshire Altrade GDD +.05 10,000 NGPL Nicor WPS GDD 5,000 NGPL Nicor Nicor Gas Company $12.00 20,000 NGPL Nicor PG&E $14.00 9,000 NGPL Nicor Kaztex $18.16 4,000 NBPL/Nicor The reason for the interest in this time period is as follows: Nicor Gas Company observed their company holiday on December 22nd, while most companies observed the company holiday on December 26th. As a result, volumes were traded for the December 22-26 time period. Gas Daily published a price of $15.70 for the December 22-26 time period. Nicor Gas Company made a decision to buy gas on December 22nd for the December 23-26 time period. I received several phone calls from various marketing companies expressing concern that Gas Daily was going to revise the posting, based on the minimal activity that transacted on December 22nd. While, my practice is to simply take the price as reported on Enron Online, from time-to-time, the there will be significant volumes transacted over the telephone that will impact the Enron Online price. My volume is a little over-stated, but simply from a cursory glance standpoint, as opposed to intentionally reporting erroneous information.",Neutral,2001

Where does this get us: 1- Sell q3 HU crack and by Q4HO crack (By the time q3 prices out--the wind will have been taken out of HU sails - plus you can do it month avg--therefore less noise) 2-Benefit from heat's recent excitement -- sell HO calls (June -Aug), buy ng puts nov-jan Ng-Disagree: I think prices stay high through June.

  Agreement and Procedures & Extension Request",j.kaminski@enron.com,vkaminski@aol.com,"Wed, 26 Dec 2001 13:42:06 -0800 (PST)",<29112207.1075840794199.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Agreement and Procedures & Extension Request Sent: Tuesday, December 18, 2001 3:51 PM Attached is the status report and motion for extension of time filed on Friday, December 14 by the Generator Interconnection Coalition drafting committee. This group is the smaller subset of the larger industry-wide plenary group formed as a result of the FERC's directive to convene an Interconnection conference to develop a consensus Interconnection Agreement and Procedures document that all of industry would adopt. As the industry plenary session yielded as much results as could be expected in a large group setting, the drafting committees were formed of Generators, Transmission Owners, Transmission Dependent Utilities, and ISO/RTOs. A committee was formed for both the drafting of the Interconnection Agreement and Procedures documents. Many of your companies are represented on one of these committees. Because the FERC set a December 14 filing due date for a final consensus interconnection document, we filed for an extension of time to complete the drafting process and finalize the documents for FERC consideration. No one entity has endorsed the document in its entirety, because drafting and negotiations are still underway. Since the larger plenary had not had an opportunity to review the documents and be provided a walk-through by the drafters, the request for an extension until January 11, 2002 for which to file a final comprehensive consensus Interconnection document was made. In addition, we filed for extension of the ANOPR comments due date which was initially set for December 21, but has been extended until January 25. This will allow for the larger plenary group to reconvene the week of January 14 at FERC for a two-day session to discuss the final workproduct. A notice designating the dates and times of this plenary session will be provided at a later date. Anticipating our filing of the status report and motion for extension, FERC granted both requests for extensions to file. Attached are the status report, motions and notice granting extension.

I have visited with Jim Derrick about having a legal/business committee representing your major groups. It would function in a similar manner as our Y2K committee did. We would have Fulbright & Jaworski give our people general instructions, our business people would canvass our companies to determine what we considered proprietary trade secrets and if we were not protecting our proprietary information appropriately, we could address that issue. Fulbright could also be used on an ad hoc basis. Costs would be shared proportionately between the major groups except special fees attributable to a specific operating group. I believe we need this inventory. If we try to enforce our non-competition agreements and we can't prove that we kept such information on a need to know basis and properly secured, we could lose the law suit.

If Brent needs some assistance at that time, I could stay for a 2-week span and meet two needs on one trip. I spoke to Mark Tawney today and he welcomes my support on the weather desk.

I will also process the Virgil and Joan Ledford deal at the same time. I just had a meeting cancel for tomorrow, which will help. Kay Rusty Stevens 09/18/2000 04:29 PM cc: Kay, We are in agreement on the x months date certain that the document needs to end. I have suggested that we propose one year. If we dont extend the deal for a second 18 month term, this actually ends the deal before the 3 year overall contemplated date. As to running it back through Accounting, I had hoped that we could avoid that since its still not an obligation that we have except as a result of our actions to begin construction of a facility, so as I see it there's no change from the previous structure - its not a put - its an automatic call. If I haven't talked you into it yet, and you feel it does need to go past accounting again, please ask them to hurry since we have an incentive to get it done quickly. I dont recall what the paragraph 5 changes were, but we are in fact spending a lot of time with Karen at this time to get the zoning approved at Pontiac. This is why we are in a hurry. We have to go for our zoning hearing on October 5th and we know we are going to be asked about the two nearby houses - Fehr and Ledford - and we want to be able to stand up and say that we too were concerned about the impact on those residents and that we have negotiated for the purchase of those homes so disturbance will be minimized. I also don't want Mr. Ledford - who just got back from vacation - to go talk to the Fehr's in the next day or so and make them re-think the deal we've gotten done with them. I know you're getting pulled in a lot of directions, and I appreciate the help. Enron North America Corp. cc: Fred Here are my observations: I agree with Rusty re: the put option complicating things for us. Second, there has to be an absolute end to this agreement at some point. If we want to have an automatic extension by commencing construction, there still needs to be a date certain after which we can go forward without them no matter what. In other words, if we want to add the language Rusty suggested, it should be limited to x months after the expiration of the option agreement. We'll need to run this back through Accounting. I really don't like the inclusion of the language in paragraph 5. If we add the language requested in paragraph 5, we need to run this agreement back through Accounting, and we may need to add some other additional language. I don't know if Rusty and Fred think we may need a zoning change for this parcel. Kay Rusty Stevens 09/14/2000 04:45 PM cc: Fred I am in receipt of the Fehr's comments to our option agreement. In reviewing them, I have the following comments: The paragraph (2) change that says they can compel us to buy their land upon a Triggering Event occurring is not going to work, because this is a put option on their part which hurts our hard cost avoidance issues. We carefully reworded previous put option language to avoid this. Also, how can we be bound to a deal when the agreement has expired ? I think we would need to say that ""if we decide to build the plant after the option period expires, then that would serve to extend the term of this agreement, however, if the option agreement expires unexercised for a one year period then we won't be bound to the deal. If the provisions of his comment (5) are indeed parallel to another similar paragraph in the document I don't have a problem with it, but ""specific performance"" scares me in general. Your (collective) call. Lets wrap this one up fast. I want to resolve it soon so I can use it as leverage with Ledford and not have him influence them. He picked a good to go on vacation, but is back in on Monday. I also told the Fehr's that if we could do this before the 15th I would go for $185,000 vs. $175,000. Since we were about five days longer than promised, I can justify the delay to end of next week, but I don't want them to think I was just blowing smoke on the extra $10,000.

DF Rod Hayslett 01/31/2001 01:16 PM cc: Mary Kay Drew Susan Steven Tracy John The consideration isn't the point, its the fact that a creditworthy party, Enron for instance, has guaranteed the business and in fact they are creditworthy. Therefore we haven't given Mavrix a special deal compared to other shippers, since they are now by way of the guarantee creditworthy. As I told you on the phone, Enron will do this for others as well, it's just not cheap, it's like dealing with the guys in the pool hall! Jerry Peters 01/31/2001 12:56 PM cc: Mary Kay Drew Susan Steven Tracy John What is the objective of having Mavrix pay its parent/affliate (ETS) a guarantee fee? Will this prove that granting credit was non-discriminatory? I would argue no, since we don't look at the consideration paid for guarantees of other companies. The fact that a credit-worthy party has issued a guarantee should be enough. Legally, Mavix is a separate company. Parent companies frequently guarantee obligations of subsidiaries without any direct consideration (other than enabling their subsidiary to transact business). Rod Hayslett 01/31/2001 07:56 AM cc: Drew Susan Steven Tracy Jerry John I didn't necessarily mean that we would pay a third party, just someone else at Enron. cc: Drew Susan Steven Tracy Jerry John I agree with Rod. By having it done by an outside party seems to make more sense from an external view. MK Rod Hayslett 01/31/2001 06:40 AM cc: Susan Mary Kay Steven Tracy Jerry John First, Mavrix is a subsidiary of what company? I don't believe I have seen that anywhere, but had heard that it was TW. If it is not a subsidiary of NNG why would NNG issue a guaranty for Mavrix? I can have the guarantee priced and then Mavrix can pay to have someone guarantee it's positions. This is not rocket science, but I believe we need to make an effort to keep things looking like they are at arms length and that this is a separate company. If you all agree, let me know and I can have someone get with Steve Harris and get the guaranty priced. For Jerry and John: Let me know but I think we can get this priced down here inside the day. Let me know how you want to proceed. Drew Fossum 01/30/2001 06:01 PM cc: Mary Kay Steven Rod Tracy I guess you wouldn't want to use any of the joint venture entities to issue the guarantee because of the complexities of their ownership structures. You also wouldn't want to go outside of ETS because of marketing affiliate issues. By process of elimination, I guess I'm OK with NN issuing the guarantee. In my view, if Mavrix' commercial strategies are unsuccessful and Northern has to perform on the guarantee, good luck recovering any of those dollars in Northern's next rate case. Thanks.

It's quite hectic here. Vince Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. - Europe cc: Vince, Any further thoughts on your end? John Vince J Kaminski 19/06/2000 15:45 cc: Dale Vince J Stinson John, It seems to me that using a risk-free rate is not appropriate. I shall elaborate on my position and send you a longer message this afternoon (my time). Vince Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. - Europe cc: John Dale Vince, John Sherriff recommended that I contact you regarding an interesting (and potentially contentious) option valuation issue we are currently dealing with in London. We hold longish term options in a private company in Turkey which is currently seeking to IPO. The issue we are discussing with RAC is which discount rate (i.e., risk-free? and if so Turkish or US?) should we use to value these options First, some additional information. Option characteristics: -- 116,000 options (representing 9% of the company) -- Term: minimum of 3 years but possibly longer -- still being renegotiated -- Strike price: 20% below the upcoming IPO price (either priced in US$ or Turkish Lire) We currently hold the above number of options with a fixed price of $118.75 per option but 34,800 expire on July 15, 2000 with the remainder expiring on December 15, 2000. The company's investment bankers (ABN / AMRO Rothchilds) are concerned regarding the strike price because it values the company at $118 million and they believe the company is worth approx $300 million. Due to such a large ""valuation gap"", they originally encouraged us to exercise all of the options by the end of June (IPO target date in late Sept / early Oct). Our counter-proposal is to ""swap"" instrinsic value for time value by repricing the options strike higher while extending their term. We are currently negotiating with RAC the most appropriate discount rate to use to value the options. We are arguing that the US risk free is the most appropriate discount rate and their current position is that the company's historical senior debt cost (18%) is the more appropriate number to use (although admit that this is not justifiable -- only a proxy) A few key points: -- RAC is valuing the options via Crystal Ball simulations such that this ""to be negotiated"" discount rate is used to calculate the PV of the future options intrinsic value in 3 years (i.e., for Black-Scholes, a higher discount rate yields a higher value but the opposite is true using Crystal Ball simulation) -- The model simulates both an IPO / no IPO case and in the case of no IPO we have put options for our equity priced at a fixed 17% return -- The model assigns a 30% illiquidity discount -- In the simulated cases where the options are out-of-the-money, we obviously do not exercise. We understand that for Black-Scholes option valuation, one needs to be able to construct a comparable portfolio of cash flows using equity futures and the risk free in order for the valuation to hold. And here is where we reach our difficulty: since the company doesn't currently trade on a public market and since equity futures do not exist for Turkish equities, RAC is arguing that a US risk free is not appropriate to use. Our argument is that the non-IPO scenario, a 30% illiquidity discount and a US$ based option volatility are already in the factored into the simulation. As such, we feel RAC's approach is double counting. If you managed to get through the above, your a patient man! I'll give you a call today or tomorrow after you've had a chance to digest the information. Regards, John Bottomley",Neutral,2000

Attached is a suggestion for how such a system might work. It builds on Offset to Last Trade functionality. The simplified description is: It tracks two variables: Intensity(Speed) and Bias (Buy or Sell emphasis). As Intensity increases, the Spread increases. As Bias increases, the Offset increases. I'll call later to see what you think of the idea. Dave Program Criteria The formula which defines the trading decision-making program will need to work with several criteria/inputs/definitions. These might be: Intensity (Speed) - The average time between transaction attempts, regardless of whether they are buys or sells. Measured as a moving average over the last [Intensity Factor] transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction Tibco messages for the Product. Obviously, the lower the Intensity calculation, the higher the transaction flow. Therefore a high Intensity number indicates low transaction flow. Intensity Factor - The number of transactions to be included in the moving average Intensity calculation. A possible value for this might be [4]. #Buys - The number of Buys which have occurred. #Sells - The number of Sells which have occured. Transaction Count - Could be either #Buys or #Sells (whichever last occured).} Buy Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Buy occurs. Sell Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Sell occurs. Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR)- The amount by which the Buy Offset should be reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount Sell Offset should be reduced if a Buy occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the ORR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be 1. Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR)- The amount by which #Buys should be reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount #Sells should be reduced if a Buy occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the TRR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be equal to 1. Spread Minimum - The minimum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this might be [0.04] Spread Maximum - The maximum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this might be [0.50] Offset Minimum - The minimum Offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A possible value for this might be [0]. Offset Maximum -The maximum offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A possible value for this might be [0.50] Initial Offset - The Buy and Sell Offset used when the program is started Initial Spread - The Spread used when the program is started Spread-Offset Minimum - The minimum amount by which Spread must exceed Offset. Prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer. A possible value for this might be [0.01] Dead Interval - The period of time which must pass before the program will recalculate the above Criteria, if no transactions have taken place during the Dead Interval. A possible value for this might be [240] seconds. Program Outputs The program should output the following variables as a result of combining the above Criteria in a user-defined Formula: Spread (integer) - as per current Stack Manager Offset (integer) - as per current Stack Manager Suspension (boolean) - Whether or not the Product should be suspended. Normally ""False"" Program Interface and Operation Principles The user should be provided with a GUI which will allow them to define a relationship among the above Criteria, which will produce and apply the Outputs to a particular Product. This relationship would be defined with Intensity Formulas and Transaction Formulas. Every time a Transaction occurs, or a Dead Interval passes, the Criteria will be recalculated and the user-defined formulas will be reviewed by the program. If a Dead Interval passes without any transactions taking place, then Intensity = Intensity +240 and #Buys=#Buys-TRR and #Sells=#Sells-TRR and Buy Offset = Buy Offset- ORR and Sell Offset = Sell Offset - ORR. If the user-defined Formulas (see following) indicate that a change in spread should occur, then if the Offset is zero (in the case of a trade occurring) or if no trade has occured (during the passing of a Dead Interval), the system shall perform a Last Trade is Mid calculation around the last transaction, adjusting the buy and sell prices according to the new Spread value. Any adjustment to the Spread shall respect the Spread-Offset Minimum. If a reduction in the Spread should violate the Spread-Offset Minimum, then the Buy Offset (or Sell Offset, or both as appropriate) shall be reduced accordingly. Similarly, if the Offset is increased by a Transaction Formula to a level greater than the Spread, the Spread shall be increased to maintain the Spread-Offset Minimum. GUI/Formulas Example: Constants Intensity Factor: [4] Dead Interval: [240] Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR): [0.3] Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR): [0.3] Spread Minimum [0.04] Spread Maximum [0.50] Offset Minimum [0] Offset Maximum [0.49] Spread-Offset Minimum [0.01] INPUTS OUTPUTS Intensity Formula Formula # Intensity Spread Offset Suspension S1 >220 -0.01 n/a F S2 <30 +0.01 n/a F S3 <10 +0.02 n/a F Transaction Formula Formula # # Transactions Spread Offset Suspension V1 <4 n/a -0.01 F V2 >3 n/a +0.01 F V3 >5 +0.01 +0.02 F V4 >10 +0.02 +0.04 F V5 >15 +0.04 +0.15 F V6 >20 n/a n/a T Note that #Transactions would be #Buys or #Sells, as appropriate. Note also that #Buys and #Sells are not intended to be an absolute count, but rather are a moving measure of the number of buys or sells which have recently occured. In this example, all Constants and Formulae are editable by the user through the GUI. Simulation Obviously, if we want to proceed, we will want to conduct several simulations to prove concepts and evaluate responsiveness. However, to give some idea of how the above might work when a market starts to run in a particular direction, please see the attached: Additional Features System Notifications There should be two kinds of notifications for the Robotrader, which will be similar to Stack Manager Garbage Checks: Warning and Failure levels for both Offset and Price. The warning levels will trigger a pager message. The Failure levels will trigger a pager message and the product will be automatically suspended. The Price checks will be against prices input by the trader (not relative price movements, but actual price). There should be both maximum and minimum price checks (e.g. gas is trading at $5.50. The notification levels could be $8 at the top end and $2 at the bottom end). Offset checks will only be against a maximum value. Dave",Positive,2001

We were hoping to bring Meagan up to look at OU this fall, with our eye on that last game of the season. However, Klein High School has started the football season very strongly, winning all games to date. That means that we may be headed for high school playoffs again this year. Meagan is on the drill team and must be at all games. Last year, we played right up to Thanksgiving in the playoffs. So, we have decided to pick a weekend in the spring after drill team contest season is over to make that trip with Meagan. We are interested in caps, shirts, etc. for UT, OU and Texas Tech.

Let me know what other schools you are talking about and I can find out for you. Again, thank you for taking time out your schedule to come up and be a part of the OU recruiting effort.

It helps us discuss it internally. Recently our internal compliance folks have discussed the ""give-up risk"". Specifically, what guarantee do we have that the executor's (Enron) FCM will accept the block trade and get it to the exchange on behalf of our clients? There is some concern that there might be limits imposed by the FCM due to issues such as credit and the high volatility of NG. They have requested we sign a four (or more) party give-up agreement between Campbell, Enron, your clearing firm(s) and our clearing firm(s). Is this the SOP as you envision the NYMEX EFS? We are at the point where the specific documentation issues are the main obstacles to moving forward.

Stacey Sent: Tuesday, October 16, 2001 9:59 AM Hi Stacey: Thanks for the background and insight information. For weekly options, if there is any, we are still using the monthly-daily blending formula, there's no different blending rules applied right now. From your email, I get it that for all deal types in East portfolio, no blending should be applied, this includes deals whose expiry frequency is embedded in the deal type but not explicitly specified (such as transmission deals) in deal entry. If this understanding is correct, we'll need to make code changes, please let us know if we should start implementing that or wait till after the meeting. Thanks, - Zhiyun Sent: Tuesday, October 16, 2001 9:42 AM The blending vs. non-blending can be confusing and could potentially cause problems down the road so I would first like to make some general statements regarding the history or this change and what the rules should be as I understand them. Only the curves applicable to the East NERC regions are being marked as a daily and monthly volatility; therefore, no blending is needed for daily options (they point directly to the daily vols) or monthly options (they point directly to the monthly vol). All curves applicable to the West NERC regions are still being marked as intramonth and monthly; therefore, blending is needed to provide a volatility for daily options. The best rules to be in place for the blending vs. non-blending would be based on curve. East curves do not blend. West curves do blend. Therefore, ANY daily or monthly option in the East would not have to blend. The potential problem that could be caused by making the rule apply to portfolios is that, for example, the East portfolio could potentially enter into an option at a West region (curve) and that transaction would need to use blended curves even though it is in the East portfolio. Options at a different expiry than daily or monthly is another problem. Are there different blending rules embedded in the code for weekly expiration? We still need to discuss this. I would be happy to all sit down and have a meeting concerning this issue whenever everyone is comfortable enough that we know all the current rules. Let me know. Stacey Sent: Tuesday, October 16, 2001 9:13 AM Just wanted to make sure that you are in agreement with the fact that the items at the bottom still use blending......let me know what you think! Sent: Friday, October 12, 2001 2:48 PM Importance: High Clarification 1, I haven't come to East Power last March. Therefore, the change must not be my request. Clarification 2, I like the change. Clarification 3, I do NOT have concerns about the difference itself, but it is scary that people (i.e., myself) don't know the difference exits. I think your summary below is very valuable and I would like to make sure Risk team and other relevant people be aware of it. Thanks Hai Sent: Friday, October 12, 2001 2:18 PM Hi Hai: Here's the logic about volatility. Originally all volality is calculated as a blend of monthly and daily volatility. From last March, based on your request, I made the changes for East and its mirrored portfolios (ENAWEATHER, ENACCO,PLANT,SVCE) only, and for option, spread and basis option only, that we use daily vol for daily option and monthly vol for monthly option. The implication of that is that for 1. other portfolios, 2. other deal types such as Asian, Transmission Deal, index option ( which East does not have right now), 3. other expiry frequency, say, WEEKLY (which East does not have right now), or deals that doesn't have expiry frequency explicitly defined, the blend approach will still be applied. Please let us know if you have any concerns. - Zhiyun",Neutral,2001

We are concerned that if we don't have people committed to stay over, especially on a weekend, we risk weak participation. Also, by rebooking with the Starwood property, we hope to potentially recoup some of the loss incurred by canceling our November date and maintain a positive relationship with the company.) Dates: Friday, February 22 and Saturday, February 23 (We received feedback that employees may not appreciate being asked to sacrifice a weekend right now.

Smutney thinks Peace may be keying off the comments of the ""unnamed"" trader in the Dow article claiming that Enron's been buying power and holding on to it. Apparently Peace's other angle is/will be: ""The same people who colluded in the design of this market are now colluding to profit unfairly from it."" No idea of when and how Peace might launch any attacks. Two immediate thoughts: Apart from the bad reporting in the Dow article, that article shows that Enron got beat by, among others, two federal (Canada and the US), one state (SRP) and one municipal (LADWP) government. David Freeman, who now heads up LADWP, was appointed ""Czar"" by the State of California and charged with the task of implementing Steve Peace's brain child (AB 1890).

Pipeline subsidiary `A-` rated senior unsecured debt at Northern Natural Gas Co. and Transwestern Pipeline Co., are also placed on Rating Watch Negative. The rating action primarily relates to the negative capital market reaction to recent disclosures by the company. The loss of investor and counterparty confidence, if it continues, would impair Enron's financial flexibility and access to capital markets, therefore, impacting its ability to conduct its business. On Oct. 16, 2001, Enron announced a $1 billion after-tax charge to earnings to be taken in the third quarter of 2001 and a reduction of balance sheet equity by $1.2 billion relating to the unwinding of structured transactions. Since that time, there have been several damaging news reports on the company and its management. More importantly, investors have voiced concerns. Enron's common stock price has plummeted and spreads on its debt have widened. The company has attempted to quell rumors and has publicly stated that it has adequate liquidity to conduct its business. Approximately $1.5 billion of unused liquidity is available under committed bank lines. An additional concern is that certain structured transactions of the company including Marlin Water Trust II and Osprey could unwind. While various sources of repayment exist, such as the sale or liquidation of underlying assets, or an equity offering, primary credit support is derived from the Enron obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock if an amount sufficient to repay the notes has not been deposited with the trustee 120 days prior to the maturity date or upon a note trigger event. In the event that the issuance of the preferred stock yields less than the amount required to redeem the senior notes in either case, Enron is required to deliver additional shares. If Enron cannot or does not deliver on its obligation, then the amount of the deficiency becomes a payment obligation of Enron, representing a general unsecured claim. While trigger events include a downgrade of Enron's senior unsecured debt below investment grade by one of the major rating agencies in conjunction with specified declines in Enron's closing stock price over three consecutive trading days, Enron would have a forebearance period of 60 days as long as an attempt was being made to register the shares. The total amount of Marlin and Osprey debt is approximately $3.2 billion. Enron has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate market value to fully pay down the associated debt. While capital market uncertainties have escalated, Fitch has no information to indicate that there are any fundamental problems with Enron's core wholesale, retail, and pipeline businesses. Fitch expects to be in contact with the company on a continuing basis to both monitor ongoing events and address strategic, longer-term issues. STOCKWATCH Enron higher after dismissing CFO Fastow 10/25/2001 AFX News (c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd NEW YORK (AFX) - Share of Enron were higher in opening trade, after the company dismissed its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, due to his past involvement in running two partnerships, in which Enron had invested, dealers said. At 9.56 am, Enron was up 1.13 usd, or 6.95 pct, at 17.55. The DJIA was down 138.60 points at 9,207.52, the S&P 500 index was down 15.95 pts at 1,069.00 and the Nasdaq composite down 39.02 at 1,692.52. Enron said it named Jeff McMahon CFO to replace Fastow, after announcing Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the Fastow-related transactions. ""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,"" said chief executive Kenneth Lay in a statement. Enron shares have fallen sharply in recent days on concerns over financial transactions made with the two partnerships, LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP, which analysts said could affect future earnings and which have prompted class action suits against the company. McMahon, who had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron's Industrial Markets group, had quit his job as treasurer last year, after voicing concerns within the company about Fastow's role in running the two partnerships, according to the Wall Street Journal. This morning, Salomon Smith Barney analyst Raymond Niles downgraded Enron to ""buy- speculative,"" from ""buy-high risk"", to reflect his concerns that ""lingering uncertainty over financial practices may begin to impair Enron's commercial operations."" ""This is the least likely outcome, in our view, but one whose likelihood has increased over the last week as questions continue to be asked,"" he said. ng/lj For more information and to contact AFX: and Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. =DJ Concerned Energy Cos Make Few Changes In Enron Dealings 2001-10-25 14:13 (New York) By Mark Golden, Kristen McNamara, Jon Kamp and John Edmiston Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Energy trading companies have concerns about the credit quality of troubled Enron Corp. (ENE), but they have made almost no changes in policies concerning the top trader of North American power and gas, the companies said Thursday. The concerns have arisen because Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in the country's power and gas markets, has seen its share price fall by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure. Moody's has put Enron's credit on watch for possible downgrade, and some of the company's debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this week. ""We have made no changes to our credit policy concerning Enron,"" said John Sousa, chief spokesmann for Dynegy Inc. (DYN). ""It's business as usual."" Williams Cos. (WMB) spokesman Jim Gipson said that his company, too, has made no changes and has no concerns about Enron's credit. Another Top 10 power and gas trading company, Aquila (ILA), has also left Enron credit unchanged. Other companies expressed concern, though they've taken little if any action. ""Like everyone else in the marketplace, we're proceeding with caution,"" said Lora Kinner, director of credit for Tractebel Energy Marketing, the North American subsidiary of the Belgian company Tractebel S.A. Kinner said the company is just looking for more information and doesn't expect to make any drastic changes. Calif Guarantees Allow Williams To Book Power Revenues By Andrew Dowell Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 10/25/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Clarifications by California as to what electricity transactions the state will back enabled Williams Cos. (WMB) to book $180 million in power sales from the previous period as third-quarter revenues, the company said Thursday. The revenues came from power Williams sold through the California Independent System Operator, which runs the state's wholesale power market and clears and settles transactions. The state of California has paid more than $11 billion for power bought directly from suppliers, but has yet to pay for any ISO power since it took over the job of buying power for the state's ailing utilities in mid-January. Two weeks ago, however, the state made clear for the first time which ISO transactions it would back. ""It's that fact that has allowed us for the first time to recognize dollars from sales to the California ISO,"" Williams Chief Operating Officer Steven Malcolm said on a conference call Wednesday. Williams reported third-quarter net income of $221.3 million on revenues of $2.81 billion, up from $121.1 million on revenues of $2.33 billion in the same period the year before. Williams is now in talks with California to secure payment for its ISO sales. The process is complicated by the state's role as guarantor of transactions undertaken on behalf of the utilities, which aren't creditworthy enough to buy power for themselves. The ISO didn't envision third-party guarantors when it set up its settlement process, and state accounting rules require more detailed bills than those sent out by the ISO each month, state power officials have said. The state says it has set aside $1.2 billion to cover ISO transactions. As reported, suppliers including Williams had charged the state with deliberately muddling the repayment issue to keep power flowing for free. Willing To Renegotiate Separately, Williams' officers also said the company was willing to discuss reworking its long-term contracts with California, provided the result benefited both parties. California Gov. Gray Davis is under heavy fire for having locked the state into contracts running as long as 20 years at prices negotiated at the peak of a market that has since collapsed. Both sides could potentially benefit from changes to the length of the term of the contracts or the specifics of power-supply obligations - perhaps freeing up supply that Williams thinks it could get more money for on the spot market, Malcolm said. ""We're always willing to sit down with a customer,"" Malcolm said. Williams hasn't been approached by the state to renegotiate the contracts, Malcolm said. Any attempt by California to force through one-sided changes is unlikely and could backfire for the state by disrupting plans for new power plants, he said. ""To the extent contracts are changed, financing is going to go away,"" he said. Downplaying Enron Opportunities Williams downplayed its ability to capitalize on the recent troubles of market-leader Enron Corp. (ENE), saying it focuses on large, long-term structured deals, not the high-volume, physical-market transactions that Enron dominates, Malcolm said. Also, TradeSpark - the Internet-based energy exchange in which Williams is a partner - is limited for now in its ability to expand and take volume from Enron's proprietary system EnronOnline because of the horrific losses operator Cantor Fitzgerald (X.CFZ) suffered in the attacks on the World Trade Center. ""That's interrupted the rapid growth we were seeing,"" Williams Chief Executive Keith Bailey said on the call. Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in the country's power and gas markets and which makes a market for those commodities on EnronOnline, has seen its share price fall by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure. Those concerns have raised questions about the business model of EnronOnline, a platform on which Enron is the counterparty in all trades. Those concerns could eventually boost volume on neutral exchanges like TradeSpark. ""We continue to believe in the neutral platform that TradeSpark offers,"" Malcolm said. TradeSpark LP was formed by eSpeed Inc. (ESPD), Cantor Fitzgerald (X.CFZ), Shell (RD) unit Coral Energy, Dominion (D), Koch Energy Trading Inc., TXU Corp.'s (TXU) TXU Energy unit and Williams Cos.'

Stocks Expected to Open Lower, Hurt By Weak Economic News 10/25/2001 Dow Jones Business News (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) A Wall Street Journal Online News Roundup Stocks are expected to open with losses Thursday, weighed down by disappointing U.S. economic news and the European Central Bank's decision to leave interest rates unchanged. About an hour before the New York Stock Exchange opened, futures on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index were sharply lower, suggesting that the Dow Jones Industrial Average will post a 94-point loss at the opening bell. In one of a trio of negative economic reports, the Commerce Department said orders for durable goods, or products expected to last more than three years, tumbled 8.5% in September. That was a much steeper drop than the 0.9% decline forecast by economists surveyed by Thomson Global Markets. Meanwhile, the Labor Department reported that the number of Americans filing new claims for state unemployment insurance rose to 504,000 for the week ended Oct. 20. That was more than the 500,000 jobless claims expected by economists. The Labor Department also said that the employment-cost index rose 1% in the third quarter, slightly more than expected. The indicator measures changes in compensation costs, including wages and salaries, as well as costs for employee benefits. Later, at 10 a.m. EDT, the National Association of Realtors is expected to say that 5.26 million existing homes were sold last month, down from the 5.5 million sold in August. Prior to release of the economic news, S&P futures had pointed to a weaker opening on Wall Street, after the ECB left rates alone despite growing political pressure for another rate cut to help the stumbling European economy. In addition to pouring over Thursday's economic reports, investors will spend much of the session sorting through a mountain of earnings reports, said Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments. Among companies that announced quarterly earnings so far, Dow Chemical said third-quarter net income plunged 84%, hurt by weak demand, substantial price declines and a slew of charges mostly related to acquisition expenses and restructuring at Dow Corning. Among other stocks to watch, Enron on Wednesday replaced its finance chief, Andrew Fastow, capping a tumultuous day in which the Houston powerhouse saw its stock price continue to fall sharply. States suing Microsoft are hiring one of the nation's top trial lawyers, signaling they may seek a harsher antitrust remedy than the White House. Meanwhile, the software giant's Windows XP formally makes its debut Thursday. In key overseas markets, stocks were mixed. London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index was down 1.2% in intraday trading, while Frankfurt's DAX was 0.9% lower. Earlier in the day, Japan's Nikkei 225 average closed with a gain of 0.7%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.2%. In Wednesday's session, Wall Street continued to shrug off disappointing earnings news, and focused instead on hopes that low interest rates and the government's economic-stimulus program will produce a recovery. Technology issues saw much of the buying, with the Nasdaq Composite Index rising 27.10 points, or 1.6%, to 1731.54. The Dow industrials inched 5.54 points, or 0.1%, higher to close at 9345.62, despite substantial losses in two of its components, Eastman Kodak and AT&T, which issued weak outlooks. In major U.S. market action Wednesday: Major stock indexes advanced. But on the Big Board, where 1.34 billion shares traded, 1,374 stocks rose and 1,743 fell. On the Nasdaq, 1.89 billion shares changed hands. Bonds gained. The 10-year Treasury note rose 13/32, or $4.0625 for each $1,000 invested. The yield, which moves inversely to price, fell to 4.588%. The 30-year bond was up 23/32 to yield 5.330%. Early Thursday, the 10-year note was up 10/32 to yield 4.553% while the long bond was 17/32 higher, yielding 5.303%. The dollar was mixed. Late in New York, it traded at 122.87 yen, up from 122.68, while the euro rose against the dollar to 89.35 U.S. cents from 89.07. Early Thursday in New York, the dollar bought 123.17 yen and traded at 88.27 cents to the euro.

Common Stock NEW YORK, NY -- (INTERNET WIRE) -- 10/25/01 -- Kaplan Fox (kaplanfox.com) has filed a class action against Enron Corp. and certain of the Company's officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. The suit is brought on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased the common stock of Enron Corporation (""Enron"") (NYSE: ENE) between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive (the ""Class Period""). The complaint charges Enron Corp. and certain of its officers and directors with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants engaged in asset and securities sales to closely related affiliates and interested parties, which disguised Enron's true financial position. Many of the details of these transactions were hidden from the public. Defendants used these asset sales to falsely improve Enron's balance sheet, thereby maintaining Enron shares at an artificially inflated price. Certain Enron executives, who held positions in the affiliates that presented clear conflicts of interest, reaped millions of dollars in personal gains from these transactions. The complaint further alleges that during the Class Period, Defendants made misleading statements regarding the potential value of Enron's Broadband business, in order to artificially boost Enron's share price. With knowledge that Enron's Broadband business would never post a profit and was seriously overvalued, Defendants continued to make misleading statements about the Broadband business in order to maintain the share price at its artificially inflated levels. Defendants used the artificially inflated value of Enron's Broadband business to hedge against, in order to gain millions of dollars in financing. Defendants failed to disclose the risk of these financing arrangements. Defendants hid the true nature of Enron's earnings, its hedging, its businesses, and the correct state of Enron's finances from its investors and the market, further artificially inflating Enron's share price. While the stock was artificially inflated for the above reasons, Enron executives engaged in extensive insider trading, gaining personal proceeds of approximately $482 million during the Class Period, before the public became aware of the above practices.

Kernen: Yeah, right. Anyone who does any trading in energy apparently, you know, uses Enron Online, so anything that destabilizes Enron to a great extent could destabilize the whole energy trading arena and... Cramer: Go ahead, say it! Say what you're thinking! No one has said it yet. We know the truth. We believe that Enron caused a national short squeeze. They knew every single number in this gas situation. They wrecked the California utility system and profited from it. That's my bet. My bet that this--they had--look, they were the market maker. Imagine if Instinet knew what you were going to be buying and took it ahead of you. I think they cornered the market for electricity for about four months, made a huge fortune and now the company is unraveling and when someone--when the Justice Department gets in there we're going to discover this.

Cramer: No, I'm saying that this is what, if I were an enterprising prosecutor, I would say, Did we have a nationwide short squeeze in electricity caused by one company that had access to all the screens and knew exactly what was happening with the electricity market which then wrecked the California utility system, cost the consumer billions of dollars, and is now being hushed up? Kernen: Well, let's talk about the actual news. Here's yesterday's trading-- Haines: Wait a minute. Kernen: Well, I just want to say that the guy is gone now. That's the new news here. Did you read--did you know that Fastow, after four-- Faber: Late yesterday. Kernen: Yeah, after four o'clock, Fastow is gone. What's interesting-- Faber: He's the CFO-- Kernen: But he's a new CFO. Faber: --who benefitted personally from some of these off balance sheet partnerships. Cramer: Mark, you know, I'm not on thin ice here, I'm not on thin ice. Haines: I just want to make sure we understand that this is your theory. Cramer: This is my theory. Haines: OK. Cramer: It is just a theory. It is my opinion. But I think we've got to find out more about that short squeeze that occurred. Haines: OK. Cramer: We need to find out whether it was orchestrated. Kernen: The new CFO might help regain some credibility for the company because he was the old treasurer who left that position a year or so ago because of some disagreements with how Mr. Fastow was doing business apparently. So now he's back as CFO and we'll whether that calms the market down. Faber: Well, what they need to do-- Joe, they need to come clean. I mean, that is what all the investors in Enron and those who've left the company as investors over this last week have wanted. Let's see everything; be as transparent as you possibly can be; tell us exactly what we need to know. And as much as they need to come clean with their investors, they need to come clean with their trading counterparties because that is really what people are concerned about. Kernen: Why is the credit worthiness issue such a big deal? Anyone who does trading with them, if their credit worthiness were to go--if their credit rating were to go down, how would that affect energy trading? Faber: Well, you want to know that they're going to be there on the other side and make good on the trades. Kernen: I guess you would, wouldn't you? Faber: Right. Not that they aren't, but why would you--if you can trade with seven other guys--seven other companies, maybe you cut back a little bit on your exposure there. Kernen: Now, why would-- Faber: And that would hurt their core business. Kernen: Why are people expecting some type of action from the credit agencies, not because of the stock price, right? Because of something that could unravel-- Faber: Because of something related to these liabilities they may have-- Kernen: That they don't know about at this point. Faber: --that they may have with regard to funding some of these off balance sheet partnerships that they backstopped in terms of borrowing that went on at the project level at the off balance sheet partnership. Will it be a liability? They don't know. But that's one of the reasons-- Kernen: We're talking hundreds of millions or billions? Faber: They don't know. Kernen: But there were billions of dollars in limited partners? Faber: Yes. About three billion in financing, I think is what some analysts estimated. Kernen: This is a pretty big number. Faber: Yeah, they can get to most of that with the assets that they have in the partnerships themselves. Kernen: I use a six month chart to show what's happened over the last two weeks. You got to look at here. But if we went back a year, you'd see eighty as far as the high for Enron. Now we're at sixteen. Faber: Everybody else took a hit yesterday. Dynegy got hurt. Kernen: Well, I got Dynegy next. Don't-- Here we go. Faber: I'm sorry. I'm getting a little excited. Kernen: You are. Faber: Enthusiastic about your charts. Kernen: There's a weekly chart of Dynegy, and you know what's coming next, don't you? Now I'm worried about the utility average. I've worried about the transportation average a lot in my career. Mark, now the utilities have replaced my worries. I'm angst-ridden. Did you see this chart? We're breaking below the-- Cramer: That's a positive, not a negative, Joe. Kernen: What's wrong with Cramer today? What happened? Cramer: I'm all fired up! Faber: He really is. My, God, he's got the DOJ getting all crazy, the FBI, the CIA. You going down to En--you going down to Houston yourself? Cramer: I may just have to. I may have to clean up that whole city. Kernen: Jim, why would the--that's the--now getting down to the lows, I mean, the other averages have come back quite a bit from the post-attack lows, the utilities are retesting those. That's not something to worry about? Cramer: No, because I think there's a lot of money going into more cyclical issues. I think the economy is showing signs of getting better. The consumer is certainly much stronger than we thought. The base book didn't say the corporate was strong, but the consumer is strong. Much stronger than before. Kernen: All right. In the past people have worried about the utility averages being a leading indicator, though. I don't--we're talking about four hundred to two-ninety at this point. That's a long way. Cramer: This average has got a lot of problems to it, but I still think that-- Kernen: It's no longer the-- Cramer: --you sell this as safety.

If so, realize your environment plays an important role in your life. Hostile environments create defensiveness, and an individual's negative behavior can directly affect others who are trying to maintain a healthy attitude. For example, if you are working with a supervisor who constantly berates those under him/her in front of others, this negative behavior affects everyone in the office. And hanging around negative friends and family members can reinforce your own negative traits. (For example, your temper is under control as long as you are not around your older brother.) In addition, negative people can induce others into developing the same negative attitudes and behaviors that they possess. It is true the company you keep is a reflection on you and can influence your behavior. Steer clear of negative environments and begin building a positive life. - CG, Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor",Positive,2001

We now have the complete API to them, but it is hooked up to their test environment. They will be sending us a contract to sign before they connect it to their production site. He assured me it will be the same contract that all the founders have to sign to get access to it. Esentially, if we trade or provide prices the API will be free; if we are voyeurs then we will have to pay for it. 2). He stated that charging commssion is not a denfensible business model. They will try to make their money through mid and back office services. 3). Their purchase of the IPE is directly related to implementing 2). his vision is to use the IPE infrastrucutre to make all derivative trades cleared and then use the FCM's to fulfill the back office movemment of funds tasks.

Things are going crazy in the gas market so, unfotunately, I'm stuck at my desk and can't go up for interviews. As far as the interview goes, my advise would be the same as any interview. Be confident. Answer the question asked. Don't be afraid to say you don't know but don't make excuses. Express interest in why you find Enron appealing compared to the other 100 companies interviewing. The trading training program is still in the works. Few people outside the trading area are even aware of its existence at this point so I wouldn't ask any questions about it in the interviews. If you receive an offer, it would probably be for a normal analyst position with the opportunity to enter the training program when you arrive. Not sure about that last statement though. The training program is geared towards our two most mature and pure trading business areas: gas and power. There are still a large number of other trading spots in our developing commodities side that would not fall under the program. That's a function of the program being developed by the head of these two businesses. Not ready to take it corporate-wide yet. Write me about how your interviews went. Good luck: John ""Adam Bayer"" on 10/19/2000 03:28:57 PM cc: Hi John, How are you today? You must be pleased with Enron's most recent numbers. Could you tell me a little more about the trading training program? You mentioned you wanted to expand it to two years, but what does the extra year entail? I have been selected for an interview next Monday, and I look forward to seeing you again. Do you have any tips on approaching the interview process? I have poured over the company website, and if you have any tips I would love to hear them. Thanks for your time, and I hope to see you Monday. Cordially, Adam Bayer",Positive,2000

Most everyone we talk to takes a macro view. + Dwight Anderson from Tudor thinks anything above $6 is a sale from the perspective of shut in industrial demand- he believes that between $6-7 no industrial (basic industry type) can operate. He tracks all the plant closures similar to what Elena does in Mike Robert's group but it seems on a more comprehensive level (Jen- it would be good for fundamentals to track this number- do some scenario analysis on it under various economic conditions- like recession!!). I will try to find out what his total number for turned back gas is- just ammonia is a little more than 1/2 Bcf which does not seem all that meaningful but the total may bring us back into balance for the summer. While he's a seller above $6, he'd also be a buyer of summer at lower levels He firmly believes in increased production in 02 (still has 1.1 day short) based on his relationship with the producing community although I personally think that 1Q02 sees little. I know that the fundamentals group is tracking these numbers from the producing community and has seen no increase in 3q over 2q and is doubtful for any in 4q over 3q. He really believes theories on products being out of whack- heat/gas, crude/propane.... + Jim Pulaski is a bull period- he really likes april and may on the 0 storage scenario- I agree that we try to build storage in April but with the backwardation out there what is the incentive??? as well, with lower baseloads for the summer- deliverability should not be an issue. I am torn on this one. + Catequil- new fund- Paul Touradji - used to be with Tiger- they do the same analysis as Dwight- just starting up and one of their mandates is to be long nat gas!! through vol or outright. + Harvard- not really sure of the view yet- they have not been active in gas just crude/products- they like buying cheap vol- because they do not have MTM issues- they like to look out in the calendar years. + The other people we are starting relationships with in the new year are: Moore Capital, Global Advisors, Caxton, Paloma Partners, Kingdon, Renaissance (program trader) - just so you know the names- as I get to know them better, I'll try to fwd on thoughts regularly.

Warren was concerned with the level of service that our group is providing. Warren explained to me the necessity and importance of calling in and reporting the actual amount of energy generated by Grays Harbor and Frontier EVERY hour. The group at BPA cannot close their accounting books and meet reliability performance measures without our information. I am meeting with Warren on Tuesday. Warren is inclined to recommend to BPA that we are incapable of this service because of our inconsistent performance. Such a recommendation would severely limit Enron's ability to produce value for our service customers in the near term and would likely prevent us from attracting new customers. I believe that we can provide Warren's group with the information that it needs with minimal impact to our trading. Therefore: We must call Grays Harbor and Frontier at the top of EVERY hour. Then we need to call BPA and communicate the ACTUAL energy generated, not an estimate. Finally, sign off the hour in the services book. Les has provided us with the needed information for each day. Reserves can only be used for the hour that we are in, than we must resupply the schedule from a different source by working with the BPA marketers. If you have a question regarding reserves or pulling a schedule--please call Les or me. If this process takes more than 5 minutes, please let me know. It is each trader's responsibilty to make this work. It should be noted that we need to do this even if the generator is prescheduled, and must to continue to do this until these generators are automatically metered. And yes, we will be compensated by the Services desk for our work. This service is a priority and should be treated as such. Please see me with your comments and concerns regarding this job function.

(Recall that this filing comes on the heels of the court agreeing to hear Edison's case asserting that the CPUC must let Edison pass through the power purchase costs to customers.) The filing is apparently very large. The lawyers at the CPUC have a copy but said that it's much too large to make a copy and aren't willing to give it to us to make a copy for ourselves. Question to the lawyers: Do we have contacts in L.A. that can go to the courthouse and get a copy of the filing for us?

This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately. To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company. Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees. The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy. This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations. I truly believe Enron can and will survive. I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does. During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity. I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community. Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here. Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years. Ken Lay",Positive,2002

According to the terms of the employment contract, if Lay quits before a change of control at the company, he is entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of years left in his contract multiplied by $20.2 million. The agreement also allots an amount to Lay for any tax-related penalties if the lump-sum payment is held to constitute an ""excess parachute payment,"" according to the Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

[Allegretti, Daniel] Yes. The DPUC issued a draft decision which declines to fund the project from the Conservation and Load Management Fund. The decision praises the project in the text but includes a footnote which is critical of the project. In addition, the DPUC issued a press release which is not helpful in promoting the project. The decision not to fund out of the C&LM fund was not unexpected. The chairman of the DPUC has been very supportive, along with Governor Rowland, but has been working offline to fund the project instead from the Renewable Energy Investment Fund. Although the REIF is a much smaller fund it appears the REIF is able to borrow against future receipts and is willing to do so based in part on their expectation of increased funding next legislative session. We are meeting with the REIF director next Wednesday to confirm where this stands. In the mean time we have filed exceptions to the draft decision which goes final tomorrow. We are told that the offending footnote will be removed but that the decision not to commit the C&LM fund will remain unchanged. In sum, the project has suffered a very real setback but has not at this time been abandoned by EPMI. Support from Rowland and others remains strong and EPMI would like to see if funding from the REIF this year is in fact viable.",Positive,2001

The growth of this business is attributable to the great mix and number of people that we have in the Storage group under Sue's direction. We feel that a big reason for our success is the great team that we have built and we have gone to great lengths to insure that we have the right mix of people in the group. This is why were so excited to see that Morgan was interested in coming back to the group. Not only does this get our staffing back to the level that it needs to be, but Morgan has proven that he is highly effective in the group. If the situation with Morgan doesn't work out then I feel the need to continue looking for the ""right"" person to replace Theresa. This approach is also the approach for the Pricing and Structuring group under Jo's leadership (i.e. insuring the right mix and number of people). We have been looking to replace Jeff Nielsen with the right person and feel that the security of our business requires another person on the Pricing Desk.

I would like to add that although Midland cannot discontinue service to ENA for failure to pay the $88,816.33 and $39,881.55 invoices, Midland can shut off service if ENA fails to pay any future invoices. So, it's imperative that someone from Northern very closely monitor the situation with ENA and Midland to ensure that ENA makes the necessary payments. In addition, the bankruptcy court may require ENA to provide Midland with ""adequate assurance"" of future payments. If required, this will most likely take the form of a cash deposit or a letter of credit. Again, if ENA fails to provide this adequate assurance, Midland may discontinue service. Sent: Tuesday, December 11, 2001 5:05 PM After the meeting yesterday and speaking to Bill Rapp and several others today I believe I can summarize the Hubbard/ENA circumstances as they exist right now: 1) The Hubbard Compression Services Agreement is with Enron North America (ENA) and ENA has filed for bankruptcy. 2) The outstanding Oct. ($88,816.33) and Nov. ($39,881.55) Midland Power Coop electric bills to ENA have not been paid, and probably won't be until the bankruptcy proceeding unfolds (if at all). 3) Under bankruptcy law, a utility cannot discontinue service to a debtor for not paying invoices outstanding at the time bankruptcy is filed and Bill Rapp has asked ENA's bankruptcy attorneys to provide the attached notice to Midlands Power Cooperative. 4) Under supervision of the bankruptcy court, future invoices received after bankruptcy was filed (Dec 2) will be paid by ENA (if they have the cash?). 5) ENA's nomination of 2,010 dth/d of ""Monthly Fuel Gas Payable"" from NNG has been confirmed and is flowing. (This is their source of cash!?) 6) Gas Accounting will continue to pay the ""Monthly Demand Charge"" ($64,549), and the ""Monthly Peak Compression Service Charges"" (ranges from $300 to $40,000). The next payment is not due until the end of December. 7) ENA's O&M payment to NNG for motor operation ($4,072.82) will be billed on the 20th of each month. One month's payment should have been outstanding when bankruptcy was filed and therefore not paid, however, it was actually paid to NNG on Dec. 6th. 8) ENA's next $320,000 ""Peak Associated Payment"" is not due to NNG until July 1, 2002. There is no certainty when dealing with a bankrupt entity, however, this is where we are today. The theme I keep hearing is business as usual. Tom, Someone from Operations should probably follow-up with Midland Power (I suggest a boat load of empathy regarding their $128,000 in limbo) after they get the ENA letter.

Their thinking was that Steve is probably a better ""deep thinker"" (to use Elizabeth's words) but that he might be bored with the routine transaction work that Shari seems to really enjoy. He also doesn't have the ISDA background which would provide tremendous benefit to us. Therefore, I think Shari is a better fit for our current needs. Having said that, I am extremely impressed with Steve. He has a better handle on this California work than anyone I've worked with yet. He seems really bright and responsive. I talked to him last week about working for Enron and he seemed interested. I didn't get into any details about our needs, but gauged his general level of interest in the work that he is doing for us and his willingness to consider jobs other than his current one. He basically said that he would be happy to hear about opportunities here. I was talking to Richard Sanders yesterday and he also is impressed with Steve and said that he had considered trying to hire him. I don't know if there is a position for Steve or not.

Agree the defcon 5 bubble has burst for natgas. Disagree about the demand destruction. ? I think some demand is just permanently gone ( i.3. cheaper BTUs in ASIA- Pacific and plants just wont run here anymore). But I think that we are underestimating the structural changes in energy demand. Just as the economy is less dependent on heavy industry for its health, energy demand is changing. Since just about everyone missed the boat on the increased power demand as a result of Silicon Valley, I think we don't have a good handle on what the drivers of the new power generation really are.So what i'm saying is that industrial demand will weaken, demand in service based industries will increase. Also energy is a much smaller component of the cost structure in service industries. ? Also I think in 2000, people had sticker shock-- they couldn't have imagined 10$ gas, but now that volatility and higher prices are firmly entrenched in their minds --- they will find ways of running their factories. Also they will budget for these prices instead of $2.50 ? See NG Week (3/5/01) Nevada power price hikes affecting casinos --- increases of 20%. When asked the implication for missed earnings and their plans for demand conservation, one casino official replied 'We're in the bright lights business' ? I don't believe the economic doom and gloom First of all no one wants a repeat of the 1990 recession ( which was much worse outside of the US) Every central bank in the G7 has or will cut rates this week. The US will follow suit or it will have a very expensive dollar which will blow exports. With all of the monetary slack, consumer credit will not tighten and thus buying will continue ( witness the lack of destruction in big ticket items purchasing). Heavy manufacturing is contracting but this is not everything. Productivity gains are strong. The economy is becoming more service based and traditional industrial barometers are not telling the whole story. ?

September 26, 2001 By KIMBERLY KINDY The Orange County Register SACRAMENTOA state Senate committee is set today to start serving 16 subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage California's energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices. The investigative committee, headed by state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough Shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the Capitol: ""the palace coup."" Lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events - directed by the man who heads the state's energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis, pushed the state into the power-buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers. The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter, the president of the Independent System Operator, acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge. Winter defied his own board and Gov. Gray Davis when he filed a 50-page request to remove the caps, records and interviews show. ""I don't know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort,"" said Dunn. The subpoenas will force those involved, including Winter, to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee, and to turn over e-mails, personal calendars and memos. Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt ""betrayed"" by the actions of Winter. ""The governor believes it was the defining moment, when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis,"" Maviglio said. Winter refused comment, referring all questions to the public relations office. ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Dunn's committee will find no criminal conduct. The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind: to keep the lights on. At the time, generators were refusing to sell power in California because of the price caps. ""It was an emergency,"" Fishman said. ""We had to take action.'' What became known as the palace coup began on Oct. 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power. The restrictions would drive prices as low as $65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the $750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier. ""They (electricity generators) grinned and beared the $750 price cap, but this new plan by ISO was too much,"" said Dunn, whose committee has been investigating since March. ""All hell broke loose.'' Records show that on Oct. 31, power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, demanding that the new plan be killed. The letters, six in all, were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators. ""If not removed immediately, the (ISO) price cap will sow confusion in the market, threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity,'' read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III. Although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps, Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials. He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to ""fix"" prices, which would violate federal trade laws. In the Oct. 31 letters, electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren't removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market. The generators got their way. The next day, the federal commission killed the new pricing plan. What was left in place was a $250 price cap established five months earlier. Power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap, saying they couldn't make a profit even under these constraints. They began to withhold power from California, and on Dec. 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts, which were narrowly averted. What followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis. Winter, who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO, submitted a 50-page emergency request, asking federal officials to abolish the $250 price cap. Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government. Neither the ISO board, which had established the price cap, nor the governor learned of Winter's actions until the cap had been removed. In fact, the attorney who helped draft the emergency request, Charles Robinson, was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made. He didn't mention anything about it. ""In retrospect, we should have told them,'' Robinson said. With the price caps gone, the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs. ""The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governor's key energy advisers with poker faces, not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment,'' Maviglio said. ""It was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant. This action accelerated the utilities' move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power-buying business."" Prices for electricity jumped from an average of $249 a megawatt to $700 a megawatt within three days, ISO records show. Dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded $30 billion. Robinson said the filing - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt Californians. Prices, he said, did not spike as a result. Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity. Robinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials. ""We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern,'' Robinson said. ""In our view, we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation. We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund."" Jan Smutney-Jones, who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators, said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap. Smutney-Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power-generating community being consulted. ""Terry did this by himself,'' said Smutney-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers. ""He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing."" The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions. Some board members pushed to have Winter removed, but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos, the governor's spokesman Maviglio said. James J. Hoecker, the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, defended making the December decision and also defended Winter. ""They filed an emergency motion, and we were not about to let California go dark,'' Hoecker said. ""They (ISO management) did what any independent system operator would do."" What Dunn's committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired. He believes memos and e-mails around the time of Winter's Dec. 8 actions should provide vital clues. ""We don't know why he did what he did, but we are eager to find out,"" Dunn said. ""Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians, but I find that argument has no basis in fact.''",Negative,2001

Pete Wilson, who signed the controversial 1996 energy deregulation bill into law, blasted his successor Gray Davis yesterday for failing to aggressively use the governor's most forceful tool -- emergency powers -- to contain the state's energy crisis. ""There are people who have ignored the supply and tried to blame the crisis on everyone else,"" the Republican former governor told nearly 100 academics and reporters at the Public Policy Institute in San Francisco yesterday. Arguing that Davis ignored early warnings about brewing problems and ""put in jeopardy parks, schools and other capital needs,"" Wilson said the Democratic governor has skillfully engaged in finger-pointing and public relations to blur perception of the current energy troubles. ""They've sought to blame me, and have done so with some success. . . . And they've found a much more profitable and exciting target, President Bush,"" said Wilson, who wryly pronounced Bush's recent trip to California as ""a triumph -- for Davis."" But Davis' strategy, he said, ""doesn't create one watt of new power."" Wilson's speech -- his toughest public remarks to date on the energy crisis -- came the day the Public Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, released polls showing Californians now believe energy ranks far and away as the state's most pressing problem. Many of those voters blame Wilson, not Davis, for the power shortages and rolling blackouts, the poll shows. The former governor's sharp words were rejected by Davis' senior political adviser, Garry South, who said Wilson is trying to ""revise history."" ""If there is one shred of evidence that Pete Wilson said one thing or raised one red flag about energy supply, let him produce it,"" South said yesterday. ""Pete Wilson accusing Gov. Davis of being responsible (for energy) is like Herbert Hoover blaming FDR for the Depression. We're trying to clean up his mess."" The GOP former two-term governor spoke on the issue of California energy as members of the Bush administration fanned out across the nation, including a California trip by Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, to push the White House's energy policy. But even the president appeared to point the finger at Wilson for some of California's problems. ""They hadn't built a power plant in 12 years"" in California, Bush told reporters Wednesday. ""And guess what? When you grow your state the way they have . . . it creates problems."" Such words chafe Wilson, who produced California Energy Commission figures that, he said, showed that small plants were built during his administration. In fact, he argued, the 1996 deregulation bill encouraged energy producers to seek state approval for new plants. While acknowledging the 1996 bill he signed was ""flawed,"" Wilson said, ""I thought the flaws would be addressed."" ""We knew it was not a perfect free market mechanism,"" said Wilson, adding that he had strong reservations about the utility rate caps included in the legislation. ""(That) was a gamble, but it was one that paid off for while."" But, he insisted, the bill -- which critics say kicked off California's energy woes -- had benefits for the state. Wilson said it was believed deregulation would spur private industry to build new plants that would fuel industry and ""lots of jobs for Californians."" Deregulation was also seen as a means to balance power companies' concerns about a lengthy, ""nightmarish"" process -- which he said dated to the early 1970s -- to build large power plants. Davis ""is now posing in front of those plants"" opening because of decisions made before he took office, Wilson noted. ""I hope that he's pleased with our handiwork."" Wilson, also lambasted Davis for failing to heed 1998 warnings from the California Energy Commission about coming blackouts. And, Wilson said, as the state faced rolling blackouts, job losses, and skyrocketing energy costs, Davis failed to use one of his greatest tools in a crisis: emergency powers. Wilson noted that after the 1994 Northridge earthquake, estimates suggested it would take 2 1/2 years to rebuild downed freeways and overpasses. He used his emergency powers to offer incentives to contractors that rebuilt the bridges within 65 days. South, noting that Davis has used his emergency powers to deal with the energy crisis, said there is no comparison between an earthquake and a full- blown statewide energy crisis.

Thanks. Lynn Sent: Friday, July 20, 2001 9:50 AM Beginning Wednesday, after the production migration, a problem was discovered with the IDD/PNR Contract Balance view on the storage menu. The view was not displaying all information; it appeared many of the total balance fields were missing and zeros were displayed where numbers should have been. After looking into the issue, we discovered that the data was never making it from the database. This led us to believe there was a driver incompatibility issue. We began working with Microsoft to find the cause of the problem. Meanwhile, we removed our ODBC changes for this particular image and went back to using native driver connections. This solved the problem with the view so it was decided to move this change to production. We are still working with Microsoft to find the exact cause of the problem. A fix was developed yesterday and moved into production last night. The view should be fixed today. I have tested it and am happy with the results. We are satisfied with the solution of switching this process back to native driver connections. I can give a more detailed explanation if you like, just let me know. Jennifer",Neutral,2001

I can respond to some of your comments. 1. In point #1, I was referring to your change in Part 1(b) which changed Section 5(a)(vi) from cross default to cross acceleration. From a credit standpoint, we prefer a cross default trigger. 2. I will check with Ed on point #2. 3. With respect to points #5 and 14, because of the difficulty in perfecting an interest in cash collateral in Canada (based on advice from our Canadian counsel as well as Stikeman's ISDA opinion on this issue), we do not accept cash collateral from Canadian counterparties. With respect to surety bonds, there is a statute in New York called the Appleton Law which prohibits a surety from issuing a bond to guaranty financial performance. For this reason, we do not accept surety bonds as collateral. 4. With respect to point #7, the answer is yes. All of the other points need to be discussed. Can we now schedule a call for later this week or next week to walk through the remaining issues? Please let me know some times that work for you and Mike roach. I am not in the office on Mondays. I look forward to hearing from you. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) Keith Ferguson 05/30/2001 12:44 PM cc: ""Michael Roach (E-mail)"" ""Paul McMillan (E-mail)"" Carol, thanks for your list. I have inserted some comments/responses on a preliminary basis in the hope that it will help Encore focus on the issues. I have not spoken to Mike Roach on the credit issues since receiving your email. Sent: Tuesday, May 29, 2001 8:57 AM Keith: As we discussed, here is Enron's legal/credit issues list on the ISDA: 1. We cannot agree to cross-acceleration. [KF: I assume you are referring to ""Default under Specified Transaction"". Encore's view (and the view of a majority of its counterparties) is that where the same parties have both physical and financial transactions outstanding, a default under one category of transaction is sufficiently significant that it should trigger a default under the other. There may be reasons why Enron feels this is inappropriate, and we would appreciate your comments.] 2. There is a note that the cross default threshold needs to be discussed. Enron's $100 million threshold is based on the threshold that its banks accept in its credit agreements. [KF: In the transactions documented in November/December of last year, the $100 million threshold was accepted as a materiality threshold in relation to Enron Corp., and a $50 million threshold was accepted for Epcor Utilities Inc. I'm not sure why the reduction to $25 million for Epcor was suggested. More importantly, I understand Mike Roach and Ed Sacks have been discussing an alternative, which would be a percentage of net tangible assets, and that Mr. Sacks was going to give that some thought. 3. We prefer elective termination on bankruptcy. [KF: Our concern is that creates a risk for the non-insolvent party in relation to other creditors of the bankrupt party who may have automatic termination clauses in their agreements. The short-form agreements signed in late 2000 appear to accept automatic termination.] 4. We prefer the Loss method. [KF: Are you opposed to the non-defaulting party having the choice between Loss and Market Quotation?} 5. We would like to discuss with you your credit rating test for defining the ""materially weaker"" standard in Credit Event Upon Merger as well as the timing for posting collateral as it appears in this provisions as well as the Credit Support Annex. We believe that 7 Business Days is too long for posting an LC. [KF: I need to discuss the first point with Mike Roach. With respect to the second point, we are advised by Epcor's treasury group that the time frame is necessary, and that is part of the reason we wish to have cash qualify as Eligible Collateral; if the time frame is required to produce an LC, we would envision putting up cash within, say, a two Business Day period and substituting an LC when it is issued.] 6. We would like to make the GP of Encore a ""Specified Entity"". We need to discuss with you your request to modify the definition of ""Specified Transaction"" to include physical transactions. [KF: I assume this is related to your first point.] 7. In the MAC Additional Termination Event, we would like to propose a cure through the posting of collateral. [KF: Agreed; I assume the value would be an amount determined by the other party, acting reasonably?] 8. We would like to discuss your proposed chnages to Section 13(b). [KF: If Alberta law is to apply, we thought Alberta courts should have jurisdiction. I understand that both parties have offices and conduct business in Alberta.] 9. We need to discuss the arbitration language. [KF: For background, this language was proposed by Enron and is consistent with the approach taken in the prior agreements.] 10. We would like to understand why you want to change the definitions of Default Rate and Interest rate. [KF: Again, this was done to ""Canadianize"" the agreement. References to U.S. rates when the currency is Canadian dollars didn't seem appropriate.] 11. Why do you want to exclude Sections 7.3 trough 7.6 of the Commodity Definitions Supplement? [KF: I intended only to modify them as set out in the Schedule.] 12. In the ""Recording"" section we would like to add the phrase ""To the extent permitted by applicable law"" at the beginning of the last sentence. [KF: Agreed.] 13. We cannot agree to No Fault Termination. [KF: This is a significant issue. In the event of a fixed for floating price swap and a protracted disruption in the Alberta Power Pool price, my understanding is that Enron would expect the swap to continue with the floating price being determined hourly by quotes from two reference dealers. Our view is that creates a significant risk to both parties that the commercial basis for their agreement will be undermined and that No Fault Termination is the better approach.] 14. We cannot accept Surety Bonds as a form of collateral to secure financial obligations. Looks like LC's would be the only form of acceptable collateral. [KF: Mike Roach advised me about the Surety Bond issue. He also advised that Enron has concerns about cash qualifying as collateral because of concerns about perfecting a security interest in cash. Can you outline the concerns?] 15. We need to discuss the credit threshold language as well as the rounding amounts. [KF: I understand that is part of the discussion between Messrs. Sacks and Roach. I also understand Mr. Sacks is undertaking due diligence concerning what he perceives to be the ""political risk"" in the Alberta marketplace, and that this needs to be completed before the specific credit issues are addressed. Can you confirm?] 16. We need to discuss what constitutes an acceptable LC Issuer. [KF: I expect both parties have LC facilities established and this point in part involves understanding which banks are involved. If the Epcor information has not been provided, please let me know and I will arrange to have it passed on.] I look forward to hearing from you.

They need volunteers from industry. They need a response today if someone wants to participate in the first round of experiments. But anyone interested should just apply soon because there will be more. You get paid for it, too, depending upon your profitability. FYI Dennis Ray ----- Dennis Ray, Ph.D. Executive Director Power Systems Engineering Research Center 608-265-3808 This is an invitation to participate in a set of electric power market experiments pertaining to the design and efficiency of markets for electric power using a unique internet platform called PowerWeb. We are interested in testing several important markets with subjects at disparate locations. You are being asked to either participate yourself or to pass this invitation on to the appropriate person in your organization. We are interested in testing individuals or institutions with experience in the power industry. Participants will compete in a series of four electricity market experiments. The commitment required will be to review approximately two hours of training material and then to participate in two, two-hour sessions during times chosen from those specified in the attached registration form. Those chosen to participate must be able to be simultaneously logged on to the internet and connected to a voice telephone line. They must also use a Netscape web browser that we will provide if you don't have one. Subjects must also be able to be paid for their participation. You will earn approximately $350-$450 for participating in the experiments. Actual earnings are directly related to your performance. You will only be paid what you earn if you complete all four experiments. In the experiments, you will play the role of an electricity generator and compete against 5 other generators (participants) to sell electricity in a market. In the market, the 6 generators submit offers to sell electricity and an auction mechanism determines the selling price(s) and what capacity is sold. No prior experience trading in electric power markets is required. We will use the results of these experiments to help determine how player strategies and market characteristics change as the market rules change. You will receive feedback at the end of the experiments about the results and what was learned.. To participate, completely fill out the registration form attached to this email and send it to Christian Vossler at On the form, it is very important that you indicate times when you will be available to participate in the experiments. Direct any questions or concerns you may have to Christian. Once selected for the experiments, you will receive a CD that includes the Netscape browser, a user manual for PowerWeb our experimental platform, and training materials. Thank you for considering this invitation. Sincerely, Bob Thomas, Professor Director of PSerc",Positive,2001

Please keep us posted as we complete the PPA's. I appreciate your help on this effort. Thanks. Lynn Sent: Thursday, December 20, 2001 11:06 AM Just a follow up on this issue. Most of the October PPAs have been processed with a few exceptions. Hopefully, all will be complete at the end of this week. We are still working on finding a way to systematically identify the late charts. I'll keep you advised of the progress on that front. Have a safe holiday ! Gary. Sent: Monday, December 17, 2001 12:21 PM All of the MidAmerican corrections for October have been made with the exception of 0737181-01,0737021-01, & 0737021-02. The charts were never received form these locations. Dan Boswell has been out of the office due to his Father's death but should be back tomorrow. We'll get a handle on the other outstanding PPAs this week. Thanks- Gary Sent: Tuesday, December 11, 2001 10:46 AM Gary and Caroline, as of today, we have emailed a list by station (7 and/or 16 day charts) to the measurement group which needs to be read for PPA's to correct the daily volumes fro the following shippers: MidAmerican - 147 stations (It is my understanding you have already 44 of the 147) IES - 87 stations Interstate Power - 6 stations Wisconsin Power and Light - 11 stations In order for Gas Logistics to keep track of the ones that need to be corrected, we would like for Measurement to send us updates on the following information ASAP: 1. Which station numbers have or have not been corrected for October. 2. How many October charts have been received and how many are outstanding 3. Provide status of November chart information. Gas Logistics needs the October corrections in the system by December 19th, which is the time frame for the first prior period run. This is important for us to be able to review the prior period invoices. As you find there are missing charts, if we can be of assistance in calling the field, please let us know. This way, the measurement group can concentrate on reading the charts. We appreciate your assistance and help in tracking these prior periods and helping each of us to keep focused to get these prior period corrections done by the next months billing. If you have any questions, please let Rick or I know. Thanks. Lynn",Positive,2001

Are you going to Miami? Spoke with Brenda last night and she said they had a great time at the big 12 championships and are planning to go to Miami for the National Championship game.
